Your 2F2 cap\\nwill have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in\\napplications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their\\nperformance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap.\\nThe other point is that big electro\\'s are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances,\\nso calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering\\nthe cold).\\n\\nYou should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain,\\nthat \"rolls over\" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every\\n1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would\\nneed a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the\\nfiring times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz\\noscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator\\nremaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.\\n\\nI would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the\\nsolenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.\\n\\nCaveat - I\\'m not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can\\'t\\nguarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable\\nconditions.\\n\\nJohnH\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n      |  _  |_   _   |_|  _   _|  _|              Electronics Department\\n    |_| (_) | | | |  | | (_| (_| (_| \\\\/           School of MPCE\\n    ---------------------------------/-           Macquarie University\\n                                                  Sydney, AUSTRALIA 2109\\n\\n    Email: johnh@mpce.mq.edu.au, Ph: +61 2 805 8959, Fax: +61 2 805 8983\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

Watson) asks:\\n > What is the objection to celebration of Easter?\\n \\n       The objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. \\nEaster (or Eashtar or Ishtar or Ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan\\nwhore goddess of fertility.  Therefore, your question to me is \"what is\\nthe objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?\"  When phrased\\nthat way I suspect (or at least I would HOPE) that it becomes immeadiately\\napparent what my objection to \"celebrating\" her would be.\\n \\n > It is celebration of the resurrection of Jesus.\\n \\n      No, you are thinking perhaps of \"Ressurection Sunday\" I think. \\n(Though I\\'m not too crazy about the word \"Sunday\", but I certainly like\\nthis phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)\\n     For that matter, stay Biblical and call it Omar Rasheet (The Feast of\\nFirst Fruits).  Torah commands that this be observed on the day following\\nthe Sabbath of Passover week.  (Sunday by any other name in modern\\nparlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection\\non the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  Why jump it all\\nover the calendar the way Easter does?  Why not just go with the Sunday\\nfollowing Passover the way the Bible has it?  Why seek after unbiblical\\nmethods?\\n \\n > I don\\'t recall a command in Scripture for us to celebrate\\n > the resurrection, but it is the sole and only reason that\\n > we are Christians--how could we not celebrate it?\\n \\n      So what does this question have to do with Easter (the whore\\ngoddess)?  I am all for celebrating the Resurrection.  Just keep that\\nwhore out of the discussion.\\n \\n > If it is only the name which is a problem, I suggest that if\\n > we are too concerned about etymology, there are a lot of\\n > words we are going to have to drop.  (As an aside, some\\n > terminally PC people here in Ottawa want dictionaries to be\\n > altered so that there are no negative definitions associated\\n > with the word _black_, so as not to offend people of colour.\\n \\n       Yes, I have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave\\nstreets with \"Afro-Canadiantop\".  <grin> (I still think \"blacktop\" sounds\\nbetter though.)\\n \\n > As a short person, I hope they will also remove the definition\\n > \"curt or surly\" associated with my physical description.)\\n \\n       Fine by me.  And while we are at it, the left-handed people are\\nboth \"sinister\" and \"gauche\" so we probably will have some objections from\\nthat quarter as well.\\n \\n > In Quebec French, the word for the celebration of the\\n > resurrection is \"Pa^ques\"--this is etymologically related\\n > to Pesach (Passover) and the pascal lamb.  So is the\\n > French Canadian (mostly Roman Catholic) celebration better\\n > because it uses the right name?\\n \\n      Yes, that sounds much better to me.

What happened to \"there is\\n > neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for\\n > all are one in Christ Jesus\"?\\n \\n      Read the letter to Philemon.  Now tell me, was Philemon\\'s \"slave\"\\nreturned to him?  Were there different rules upon the slave than upon\\nPhilemon?  How about male and female?  Are there different \"rules\" that\\napply to them as well?  Or if there is no more \"male and female\" can Adam\\nand Steve get married to each other in your congregation?  Yes, there are\\ndifferences in form and function.  But the way we come to Salvation in\\nMessiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.\\n \\n---------------------------------------\\n\\n[I am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it\\nseems repetitive, but this particular point is one that I believe is\\nnew -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.\\n\\nI\\'d like to suggest that people think very carefully about this\\nargument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of\\nthe week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some\\nChristians prefer to refer to \"first day\", \"second day\", etc.  However\\nthe majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question\\nseems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows\\nas the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when\\nthey use it is different.\\n\\nIndeed I\\'d like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be\\ndangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the\\ncelebration of Christ\\'s resurrection.  Postings trying to convince\\nthem that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run\\nthe risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.\\nThey are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people\\'s minds\\nbetween their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It\\'s not clear that\\nthis is a healthy thing.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \\n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \\n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \\n    \\n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \\n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \\n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \\n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \\n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\\'s Theory has they have. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many \\n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \\n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \\n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \\n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles \\n          of Larson\\'s Theory should be included in all related courses \\n          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and \\n          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a \\n          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. \\n    \\n          \\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n\\n                                       Robert E.

Yesterday was the most recent one;\\nsomeone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.\\n\\nI\\'m really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it\\ncould have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.\\n\\nThere was no note.  I do not know if it was:\\n\\n\\t- someone\\'s idea of an innocent joke, that went awry\\n\\t- someone\\'s sick idea of flirting\\n\\t- an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)\\n\\nI dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask\\nme some kind of question, I don\\'t know the answer so I take a military\\nspecification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out\\nfalls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a\\nBible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to\\nCorinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love\\nAssociation?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.\\n\\nI can lock up my desk, but I can\\'t lock up every book I have in the\\noffice.  I can\\'t trust that someone won\\'t shove something into my\\nbriefcase or my coat pocket when I\\'m not looking so that I go home to\\nfind such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone\\nwants to do to my body.\\n\\nTo make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to\\ntreat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for\\nleaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go\\nto the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\nperson had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\\ncould be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\\nnumber was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a\\nneutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite\\nthe fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being\\nleft in my desk drawer.\\n\\nI need some prayers --- I can\\'t stop crying. I am so deeply wounded\\nthat it\\'s ridiculous.\\n\\nI feel like I\\'m some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to\\nreduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.

Please pray\\nfor my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a\\nwhole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job\\nin a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such\\nharrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts\\nappropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This\\ncompany, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment\\nisn\\'t tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one\\nfemale engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or\\nthreatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven\\ntimes in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company\\ndo me no good when I\\'m terrified or healing from the latest assault.)\\n\\nAnd please pray that I don\\'t turn into an automaton because of this.\\nThat\\'s my bad habit: \"ignore it and it will go away\", \"you\\'re not worth\\nanyone\\'s time so don\\'t go talking to anyone about this\", \"you\\'re right,\\nyou are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this\\nway\", \"you are just an object\", \"you prostitute your mind to this\\ncompany so why can\\'t others expect you to prostitute your body there as\\nwell?\", \"what makes you think women aren\\'t just possessions, and\\nnothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?\"\\nThis is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major\\ndepressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don\\'t come into\\nmy head and stay there, triggering depression.\\n\\nPlease pray that this latest trauma doesn\\'t come between me and God.\\nIn a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to\\nGod, and it\\'s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can\\nseparate one mentally from God.

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\\n\\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that\\'s really beside\\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n\\n\\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\\n | \"Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can\\'t we all just live together       |\\n |  I don\\'t wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\\n |  I deserve to have a future...\"                                         |\\n |                                     -The Good Girls    \"Future\"         |\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n\\n',\n",

Exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles\\nexercised (example: look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching\\narms and non-pitching arms in major league pitchers).  However, if exercise\\nalso leads to reduction of body fat, the loss of body fat will be equally\\ndistributed over the entire body.

I get a little queasy around the phrase \"aren\\'t morally \\nresponsible\", perhaps because I\\'ve heard it misused so many times.\\n(I remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who\\nwas drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) In general,\\nmost folk can\\'t control their dreams, but perhaps what you do all day\\nand think about has some impact on them, hm? And I\\'m not sure what\\n\"actions\" are in a dream. But I will note that Jesus does seem adamant\\nabout the fact that our thought-life is at least as important as\\nour actions. Go lightly with this argument - we are all morally\\nresponsible for *who we are* and dreams might well be an important\\npart of that.\\n\\n>Now, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\\n>1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\\n>applies beyond what might be called \\'mental hygiene\\', that is, not trying\\n>to think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\\n>thoughts.\\nI don\\'t know a thing about Out Of Body Experiences. I\\'ve had dreams, some\\nfairly vivid ones; is an OOBE just a very vivid dream? I would argue that\\nextreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky; it is probably\\nmuch better to think about who Jesus is, and who we are in relation to that,\\nthan to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. Unless you feel plagued by\\ndreams that are painful and out of control; then pray about it and/or get help.\\n\\n>2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are \\'another plane\\')\\n>Evidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\\n>common by more than one person.\\nWhat on Earth is your definition of \"often\"? I know exactly one case of\\ntwo people who had substantially the same dream at the same time, and\\nas they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things I could\\nsee why their dreams might be similiar. Anyway, the only \"other plane\" I\\nknow of is the spiritual realm. I don\\'t think *anyone\\'s* dreams,\\nperhaps outside the occasional prophet\\'s, represent actual actions on an\\nalternate plane. If they were real actions, or conscious thoughts, then\\nyes they would have direct moral significance.\\n\\n>3) Like (2), but here we assume that [garbled text: \"because the dream occurs\\nin a different environment, then different moral laws apply\" is my guess of\\nwhat you said.]\\nI don\\'t see the slightest hint in Christian writings that ones \"environment\"\\nchanges the way a person determines what is moral. For a Christian won\\'t\\nit *always* come down to \"what Jesus would have us do?\"\\n\\n>So... There it is.  Is one of these cases the truth, or does anyone know\\n>of another alternative?  respond by post or email.\\nTruth? I don\\'t claim to be an expert in dreams. I\\'ll note that the Bible\\ndoesn\\'t talk much about dreams outside of the realm of God using them to speak\\nto us, with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear, as it\\nwarns somewhere in the OT. Given that, I would not give them a lot of\\nattention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.\\n\\nI would discount talk of \"alternate planes,\" though. The only places such\\nconcepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to\\nChristianity, though I\\'ve run into the occasional exception. If you are,\\nor want to be, a Christian, you want to be very careful about ideas like\\nthis. \\n',\n",

By far the easiest way we have found  \\nto do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then  \\nCOPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that  \\nmachine\\'s type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have  \\nten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies  \\nthis considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are  \\nall network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.\\n\\nOften, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor  \\nto one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is  \\nusually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe  \\nthe original poster was asking about.

And these will pay the penalty of\\neternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of\\nHis power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be\\nmarveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was\\nbelieved.\\n\\nThings to note from this passage.  Unbelievers are both those who openly reject\\nthe gospel, and those who do not know God.  The eternal destruction is the same\\nas the eternal hope in 2:16.  This distructions primarily emphasize that it is\\nseparation from the presence of God.  THe context is speaking of the 2nd advent\\nwhile 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  Don\\'t confuse the two. \\n>\\n>In the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of\\n>hell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment.\\n\\nYet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.\\n\\n For instance,\\n>it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can\\n>continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or\\n>whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is\\n>burned up.

Also, the Daniel acct. shows that the laws of\\nnature can be interupted even with earthly fire.\\n\\n>It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,\\n>the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell\\n\\nMaybe you don\\'t understand.  There will be those who are alive at the end of\\nthe millenium, who will walk straight into the GWTJ.  Even those who have died\\nin their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to\\nreceive condemnation.\\n\\n>i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can\\'t feel physical pain.\\n\\nThis is contrary to the teaching of Scripture.\\n\\n> What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are\\n>to be forever without God. \\n> \\n>The Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener\\n>think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people\\n>won\\'t listen to God even after he rises from the dead. \\n\\nTHis is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the \"no physical\\nbody\" thesis.\\n\\n>The point of\\n>the parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening\\n>to the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.\\n>It seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is\\n>not even remotely pleasant.\\n\\nThe true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from God, after\\nhaving seen the glory of His presence at the GWTJ.  But whether it was open\\nrebellion against the revealed gospel of Christ or if it is not having known\\nGOd (not saught Him as He is), then as Paul says, they are without excuss and\\nthat every mouth will be stopped.

Many different observations, including IRAS\\n> and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures\\n> can range from 40K to 150K.\\n\\nInterstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\"\\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\n\\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\\nby any conceivable observation.\\n\\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\n\"average\" temperature.\\n\\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\n\\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\\nAllen\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\\ncooked if that were the case.

They are essentially\\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\\n\\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\\n\\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\\nreceive, it didn\\'t really offer all that much help on transmit so I\\ndidn\\'t bother with it.\\n\\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data\\nstream is another matter entirely.\\n\\n  Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a\\n\"beacon\" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow\\ndue to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO\\nalso shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even\\nthough the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes\\nof the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of\\na second.\\n\\n  I\\'ve been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in\\nand get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland\\nIDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the\\nproceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running\\nlow on resources of time, money and energy.\\n\\n  If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW\\nID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma\\nMtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally\\npolarized.\\n\\n  I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly\\napproach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and\\nyou might want to carefully consider your \"target\".  If you can\\'t\\narrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think\\nyou\\'ll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by\\nmultipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS.\\nFor more details, see the 10th CNC.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

She said\\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\\nchange...but I shouldn\\'t have married to person in the first place )\\nand more....\\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\\ncounsel.\\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\\nwith whom we come in contact.\\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\\npeople. (wouldn\\'t kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)\\nIt is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer\\nlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.\\nThink about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that\\na friend is in error, but you don\\'t want to \"cause trouble\".\\nRighteous prayers is great power, but don\\'t forget that we are\\nwe are Christ\\'s lips and hands on earth. Don\\'t be afraid to\\nsimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it. Say a\\nfervent prayer and ask the Holy Spirit for Love and guidance.\\nIn more ways than we may realize, we *are* our brother\\'s\\nkeeper.\\n\\nIn Jesus and Mary,\\nElizabeth\\n',\n",

While\\nthere is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no\\ninjunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But\\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\\n\\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\\nceremony itself.\\n\\n| Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\"\\n| had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely\\n| from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.\\n\\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\\n\\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\\n\\nWritings dealing with Jesus\\' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter\\'s response is \"You seem\\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\\n\\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\\ndon\\'t intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\\n\\n| Neither New Testament\\n| Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.\\n\\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\\n\\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\\nwhich I have taken a few:\\n\\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\\n\\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\\n(Matt. 19:11).\\n\\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\\nnow\" (John 16:12).\\n\\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\\n\\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\\n\\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\\n\\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\\n\\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\\nwere actually taught openly.\\n\\n| I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire\\n| practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual)\\n| from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative\\n| information on whether or not this claim is true?\\n\\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\\nconnection has yet been established.\\n\\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n',\n",

One application is soldering\\nto the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These\\nwere notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.\\nIf you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver\\noff of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated\\nsolution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be\\ndisolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts\\nare quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.\\n--\\n-->>>>>>>>>> Peter Reilley ..... pvr@wiis.wang.com .....

For\\ninstance, \\'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering\\' might be thought of as a\\nplausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the\\ncontention remains true, just as \\'5 + 7 = 12\\' remains correct even if\\nthere is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to\\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\\ncontent;  \\'One ought always to do the right thing\\' is plainly true in\\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\\ntalk of \\'self-evident truths\\', but can he deny the subjectivist\\'s claim\\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion\\nis, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have\\npreferences regarding human activity.\"\\n \\nDavid Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\\n\\n74LS\\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\\n\\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\\n\\tdevices.\\n\\n74F\\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\\n\\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\\n\\n74AS\\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\\n\\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\\n\\n74ALS\\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\\n\\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\\n\\n74C\\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\\n\\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\\n\\tCMOS 74 families.\\n\\n4000\\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\\n\\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\\n\\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\\n\\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\\n\\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\\n\\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\\n\\tclear choice when speed is not important.\\n\\n74HC\\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\\n\\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\\n\\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\\n\\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\\n\\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\\n\\tconsumption at faster speeds.\\n\\n74HCT\\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\\n\\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\\n\\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\\n\\n10K\\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\\n\\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\\n\\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\\n\\tthe rules or it won\\'t work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\\n\\tcan be expensive.\\n\\n100K\\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\\n\\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\\n\\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\\n\\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\\ninteresting but I haven\\'t used either significantly yet.\\n-- \\nAll work is one man\\'s work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\\n',\n",

The properly-formed conscience can\\nbe trusted virtually ALL the time.  I am not so sure, though, about something\\nso materialistic as the human brain.  Does that mass of tissue possess\\nanything trustworthy?  Your observation would probably be valid if we were\\ndiscussing the \"mind\" of an animal, but the human being is only half animal,\\nas it were; and half spiritual. \\n\\n?At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\n?possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\\n?not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\\n?Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn\\'t say.  We interpret this passage\\n?using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\\n?that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\\n?is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\\n\\nNow you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\ninfallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\nChristianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n \\n?Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\\n?of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\n?cannot be certain.\\n\\nThis argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a\\nconclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me\\nof the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of\\na measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying\\nto measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the\\nmeasurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to\\ndetermine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this\\nknowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough\\nto allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation.\\nTherefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\ncompetence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\nability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\nnot subject to the experimental method. \\n\\n?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n?\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\\n?

I originally\\nwrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone\\nhere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but\\nare missing some higher-level functionality.  They\\'re intended more as an\\nintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.\\n\\n*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it\\n*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I\\'ll make the mods and re-post it as a\\n*** different version.\\n\\nThe routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They\\nare fairly simple, but I\\'ve found them to be very fast (for my purposes,\\nanyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a\\n\"virtual screen\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with\\nno transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy\\nareas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I\\'ve also included a\\nsimple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256\\ncolor GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick\\'n\\'dirty(tm) demo program\\nthat bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three \"windows\".\\n\\nThe whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip \\nIt is zipped with pkzip 2.04g\\n\\nIt is completely in the public domain, as far as I\\'m concerned.

In a recent\\nissue, there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read.  It\\nsaid:\\n\\n  \"There\\'s nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer\\nindustry.  The industry NEEDS an IBM for the 90\\'s.\"\\n\\n  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the \"cracker\" ethic, which is something\\nentirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the\\nfree distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is\\nit that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to\\nhave a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person\\nlike myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,\\ncrannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any\\nuseful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely\\nignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to\\nmake truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves\\nhackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact\\nthat the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so\\nfor a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a\\nvolume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller\\nthan it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the\\ncorporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the\\n286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  \\n\\n  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of\\ninnovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud\\nit; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative\\nsystems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the\\nproblem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for\\nblunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.\\n\\n  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,\\nwhere?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves \"hackers\"\\nallowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,\\ninteresting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the\\ncomputer industry?\\n\\n  I await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.\\n\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n|  pstlb@acad3.alaska.edu     |  \"Revenge is a dish best served cold.\"       |\\n|  \"Szechuan Death\"           |          - Khan Singh                        |\\n|                             |            \"Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan\"|\\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n',\n",

In many types ofexperiments the \"prediction\" is that the observed phenomena will happen again\\nand be capable of being observed. For example, in chemistry someone may predict\\n: the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction\\nrepeatedly. You can\\'t repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. So it seems we could never say, \"That\\'s exactly how it happened.\"As far as we know that event was unobserved.

I attend a Vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an\\ninerrantist, though I\\'ll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately\\npre-mill, and evangelical. But, I\\'m not ready to damn those who use icons,\\nsay mass in latin, uphold the Virgin Mary (though I really don\\'t believe\\nthat she was sinless), vote on Church membership, or insist on baptism for\\nsalvation. Of course, I think my doctine is pretty close to the truth -\\nwhy would I follow it if I believed something else was closer to the truth?\\nBut my understanding of the reality of a walk with Christ is continually\\nevolving as I spend more and more time walking with Him, studying His word,\\nand fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family. \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.                    \\n  --T.S.

Back\\nthen, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed.\\nAfter all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of \\nthousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and \\nmillions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and \\nother people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.

It is evident that the West, especially America,\\nmisjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and \\nthreatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world\\'s\\noil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been\\nprevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West\\nbefore Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is\\nresponsible for his decision to invade.

It is precisely the lessons the world learned\\nin WW2 that motivated the Western alliance to war.

Both the \"External Tank\" and\\n\"Wingless Orbiter\" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign\\noptions list. Today\\'s (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports\\nthat O\\'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have\\nbeen dropped, such as using the \"giant external fuel tanks used\\nin launching space shuttles,\" and building a \"station around\\nan existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.\"\\n\\nCurrently, there are three options being considered, as presented\\nto the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in\\ntoday\\'s Times).\\n\\nOption \"A\" - Low Cost Modular Approach\\nThis option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,\\nthere are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting\\nthe SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and\\nReston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective\\nteams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this\\noption are:\\n  -  Uses \"Bus-1\", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that\\'s\\n     qualified for STS and ELV\\'s. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C\\n     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this\\n     for the Air Force.\\n  -  A \"Power Station Capability\" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.\\n     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle\\n     flies in an \"arrow mode\" to optimize the microgravity environment.\\n     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power\\n     source for 30 day missions.\\n  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term\\n     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the\\n     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing\\n     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International\\n     Partners\\' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The\\n     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.\\n     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.\\n  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and\\n     add another 20 kW of power\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,\\n     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return\\n     Vehicle).\\n\\nOption \"B\" - Space Station Freedom Derived\\nThe Option \"B\" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.\\nThis option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we\\nhave all come to know and love :)\\n\\nThis option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for\\nuse on all SSF assembly flights (so does option \"A\"). Also, the \\nnumber of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,\\nfor both options \"A\" and \"B\".\\n\\nThe build-up occurs in six phases:\\n  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power\\n     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when\\n     it visits.\\n  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist\\n     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is\\n     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.\\n  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by\\n     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes\\n     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the\\n     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).\\n  -  A \"Two Fault Tolerance Capability\" is achieved after 14 flights,\\n     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal\\n     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.\\n  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,\\n     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the\\n     assembly in 24 flights.\\n\\nMost of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, \\nwith the exception of the data management system, which has major\\nchanges.\\n\\nOption C - Single Core Launch Station.\\nThis is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter\\ncylinder that\\'s 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on\\nthe backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a \\nregular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket\\nmotors, and launch the can. Some key features are:\\n  - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout\\n  - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels\\n  - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against\\n    micrometeroid & orbital debris)\\n  - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end)\\n  - 7 berthing ports\\n  - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet\\n    (twice the volume of skylab).\\n  - 7 floors, center passageway between floors\\n  - 10 kW of housekeeping power\\n  - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal\\n    loops, dual environmental control & life support system)\\n  - increased crew time for utilization\\n  - 1 micro-g thru out the core module\\n',\n",

Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  \\n\\nI can only understand that by \\'\"useful in making some conclusion\" is an accuracy\\njudgement\\' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in making\\nthat conclusion or not.   That\\'s part of what I mean by objective\\nvaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn\\'t value x for the \\npurpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn\\'t really do that. The\\nrest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own \\nfreedom) are solid facts in themselves.\\n\\nConsider each of the following statements:\\n\\n(1) The only reason that the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\n\\'inaccurate\\' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  \\n\\n(2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people\\nfinds the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\'inaccurate\\' useful in\\ndealing with phenomena.\\n\\n(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in\\nmodelling phenomena.\\n\\nWhere is the \\'pun\\' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  \\nAnd what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that \"the \\nbasis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. \\n\\'subjective\\' values\"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a \\n\\'subjective\\' value judgement?  (an \\'accurate\\' value judgement, maybe?)\\n\\nJust to illustrate what I mean: what\\'s the difference between saying\\n\\'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have\\nto model phenomena\\' and (say) \\'Love and intelligence are the best tools we have\\nto achieve freedom\\'?  Is one \\'objective\\', the other not?  Both are \\njudgements about value (\"best\"), and both have the same empirical basis, from \\nwhere _I_ sit.\\n\\n#Sorry, Frank, but all you\\'re doing is\\n#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you\\n#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,\\n#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it\\'s based\\n#on value (goodness) judgements, that\\'s nonsense. By contrast,\\n#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I do mean to say that it\\'s based on \"goodness\" judgements.\\n\"Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) \\ntools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate \\npredictions\" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.  A \\nrelativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of \"science\", \\nor of a given scientist - but it seems pretty solid and objective to me.\\n\\n-- \\nFrank O\\'Dwyer                                  \\'I\\'m not hatching That\\'\\nodwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\\n',\n",

The blue (and red\\nor orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist\\nformulation and are applied in a different manner.

You are probably thinking of Church of God in\\nChrist, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.\\n\\n\\t2)  I\\'m not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it\\nshould be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it\\never, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. \\nThe doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is\\nthat speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming\\na Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be\\nwhat you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are\\nfrequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order\\nto be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\\nmajority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in\\nMark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally\\ndo not interpret this as meaning if you don\\'t pactice the signs you aren\\'t\\n\"saved\".\\n\\n\\t3)  I know it\\'s hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that\\nhas such diversity, but I think you\\'ve made some pretty big\\ngeneralizations here.  Do \"Neo-Pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a\\nsign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? \\nI\\'ve never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them\\nas believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as\\na sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be\\ninclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend,\\nthey do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be\\ncharismatic.\\n\\nKen Banner\\nDept. of Religious Studies\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\\nkbanner@philae.sas.upenn.edu \\n',\n",

To assist cooling\\nand the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the\\nhot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than\\njust air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is\\nrapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently\\nseen rising out of these towers.\\n\\nThat slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because\\nit produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of\\nthe air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.\\n\\nThe towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam\\nsystem of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the\\nboiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across\\nthe turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and\\nby recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it\\nback to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference\\n(sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage \"hot\"\\nturbine to final stage \"cold\" turbine).\\n\\n                                        R.

Science is no longer\\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\\n\\n There is no need\\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\n: determnined.\\n\\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\\nwill or not? \\n\\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\n: its products.

It seems intelligence is useful - when\\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \\nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\\nand preserves.

I value events and things subjectively, from\\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \\n\\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\\nfor starters.\\n\\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned?

What law of nature can you invoke to\\n: establish your values.\\n\\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\\nseverely flawed.\\n\\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one\\'s\\nown people.\\n\\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\\nof other nations. \\n\\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\\n\\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n: - that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\n\\nIt looks like you haven\\'t bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \\nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\\nof some physical event), and other\\'s happiness, too, if the observer\\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\\nmeaning. \\n\\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \\npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\\ndo not exist. \\n\\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others\\'\\nexistence.\\n\\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \\n\\n: That you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\n: or God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\n\\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\\n\\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\\ncease to be subjective. \\n\\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \\ninherently subjective. \\n\\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\\nwe don\\'t, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one\\'s\\nown and then to get mad at this. \\n\\nGod must be schizophrenic.\\n\\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\n: weight whatsoever.\\n\\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\\n\\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \\n\\nPetri\\n\\n--\\n ___. .\\'*\\'\\'.*        Petri Pihko    kem-pmp@          Mathematics is the Truth.\\n!___.\\'* \\'.\\'*\\' \\' .

What the supply must do,\\nif presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the\\nsupply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal\\none amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we\\nshould read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm \\nresistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by\\nnecessity, must be 1V.\\n\\nThe only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves\\na circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output \\npower transistor, and therefore reduce the output.\\n\\nSo, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?\\n\\nThanks in advance.\\n\\nAndy Collins, KC6YEY\\nacollins@uclink.berkeley.edu\\n\\nps: If anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project, I agree fully,\\n    but I still have to do it, its graded ;^)\\n\\n\",\n",

It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science\\nCenter in Thousand Oaks, CA.\\n\\n   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space\\nMaterials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell\\nInternational in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world\\nauthority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or\\ncoauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial\\nmaterials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David\\nCriswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.\\n\\n   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal\\nexperts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build\\nthe Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a\\npotential to power the globe.\\n\\n   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half\\nfrom California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific\\nconcept of a solar power system based on the Moon.\\n\\n   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar\\nsurface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted\\nthrough orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous\\nsource of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth\\'s ever\\nincreasing demand using proven, basic technology.\\n\\n   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space\\nIndustrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the\\nNational Space Society, which is an international non-profit\\norganization that promotes development of the space frontier.\\nThe Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.\\n\\n       WHERE:  Rockwell Science Center Auditorium, 1049 Camino\\n               Dos Rios, Thousand Oaks, CA.\\n\\n   DIRECTIONS: Ventura Freeway 101 to Thousand Oaks, exit onto\\n               Lynn Road heading North (right turn from 101\\n               North, Left turn from 101 South), after about 1/2\\n               mile turn Left on Camino Dos Rios, after about 1/2\\n               mile make First Right into Rockwell after Camino\\n               Colindo, Parking at Top of Hill to the Left\\n\\n',\n",

We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity\\nand Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher\\nsaid that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, \"What??\"\\nI did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are\\nso kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them\\n(in my point of view, they don\\'t sin as much as I do). How come if they\\nwere under Satan, they could have such personalities. \\n\\nTo tell you the truth, I don\\'t know much about Islam.\\nBut I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of\\njudgement.\\n\\t\\n\\tNow I\\'m  asking you what your opinions about Islam and \\nits teaching. \\n\\nIMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.\\n\\t    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.\\n\\nP.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,\\n     and bit.listserv.catholic.\\n\\n\\nIn Christ, our Lord,                           Smile.........\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t       Jesus loves you.......\\n\\tTabut Torsina\\n\\tTORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU\\t   \\n\\n[Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a\\ndiscussion of Islam, since there\\'s a group for that.  But I suspect\\nthe point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.\\nIndeed it\\'s going to be impossible to see what he was getting at\\nwithin your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians\\nare saved is at the heart of it.\\n\\nThe classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until\\nthe last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)\\nwas the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions\\nworshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a\\ncorollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and\\npossibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there\\'s no\\ntruth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are\\nintentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,\\nSatanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might\\ncontain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would\\nbe missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.\\nIf this is the background of your teacher\\'s remarks -- and I suspect\\nit is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily\\nrelevant.  The point is not that there\\'s anything intrinsically wrong\\nwith it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners\\nmay all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a\\nfollower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.\\n\\nThis is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.\\nChristianity says that salvation isn\\'t a matter of being kind and\\nnice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no\\none is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.\\n(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There\\'s a\\nCatholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in\\ndifferent terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible\\nways.  But if it doesn\\'t have Christ, it\\'s like a diet that consists\\nof food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some\\nessential food element so that you end up dying.\\n\\nLet me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.\\nWhat I\\'m trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is\\nnow relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other\\nreligions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an\\nunfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move\\nwithin Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental\\nGod.

It was a bit shorter\\nthan I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big\\npresentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more\\nbare-bones.\\n\\nIn any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would\\nhear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,\\nmaybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it\\nin.\\n\\nAfter the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written\\nquestions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only\\nhad monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.\\n\\nSo, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question\\nbeing read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.\\nPresumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nSo, on to the substance. The question was \\n\\nIs Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such\\nas a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete\\nwith the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed\\nby Mcdonnell Douglass?\\n\\nWell, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,\\nthen he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last\\npart first.\\n\\nThis is to the best of my recollection what he said.\\n\\nAs far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better\\nanswer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers \\nabout that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High\\nspeed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at\\nthis point.\\n\\nSo, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial\\narena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that \\nthey consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them\\nto persue work on their own.\\n\\nNow, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,\\nthis is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this\\nguy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space\\nlifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where\\nthe TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman\\nof the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are\\ntrying to do something with it.  \\n\\nAnybody know anything further?\\nIs this really news?\\nDoes this threaten further work on DC-? ?\\n\\n                    John.\\n\",\n",

Unfortunately, you never \\nstate why faith and dogma are dangerous.  \\n\\nIf you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in\\nWaco, you are missing the point.  \\n\\nThe Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the\\nmessenger.

A Christian is perfectly capable of\\nbeing a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in\\nGod is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists\\nwould make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a\\nGod which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n>I claimed that a ``Christian philosopher\\'\\' is not a Christian,\\n>but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those\\n>of Christianity.

Ever heard of parole?  You have read far\\ntoo much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion\\nbased on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this\\ndefinition imply that one cannot change one\\'s mind.  In prison, however,\\nyou can\\'t just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.

When you encounter references to Heaven\\nin terms of crowns and harps and golden streets, I trust that you do\\nnot suppose (or suspect Christians of supposing) that the golden\\nstreets are to be taken literally, still less that they are what the\\nconcept of Heaven is all about. Why then should you suppose that\\nabout the \"fires\" of Hell?\\n     Have you read the novel ATLAS SHRUGGED? Do you remember the\\nlast description of James Taggart, sitting on the floor beside the\\nFerris Persuader? This comes close to a description of what is meant\\nby Hell in my circles. If the image of fire is often used in this\\nconnection, there are two reasons that occur to me.\\n     The first reason is that it conveys the idea of Hell as\\nsomething that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as\\nany rational being would wish to avoid the fate of James Taggart --\\nbut the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read ATLAS\\nSHRUGGED, a smaller audience than those who have played with\\nmatches).\\n     The second reason is the history of the Hebrew word \"Gehenna,\"\\none of the words translated \"Hell\" in the New Testament. It refers\\nto the valley of Hinnon, outside Jerusalem. In early days, it was a\\nplace where the Canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)\\nto Molech. Later, it was made a garbage or refuse dump, where fires\\nburned continually, consuming the trash of the city of Jerusalem.\\n\"To be cast into Gehenna\" or \"to burn in Gehenna\" thus became a\\nmetaphor for \"to be rejected or discarded as worthless.\"\\n\\nLest you think that identifying Hell with the fate of James Taggart\\nis my own private fancy, I commend to you the book THE GREAT\\nDIVORCE, by C S Lewis. It discusses Heaven (no harps) and Hell (no\\nflames). It is shorter than ATLAS SHRUGGED, and available at most\\nbookstores and libraries.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n',\n",

Older original deskjet and\\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\\n\\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\\n\\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\\nservice center for further information.\\n\\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\\n\\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\\n\\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\\n\\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\\nproblem.\\n\\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\\nlaserjet IV.\\n\\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\\n\\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\\n\\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nBill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department\\nRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511\\nwtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED\\n\",\n",

It released\\n>all churches from the use of the Latin Mass (unity) to allow them to\\n>speak to the people in the common language (diversity). \\n\\nIn Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one\\ncongregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in\\neach city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they\\nformed something of a stew, with different members having different\\nheritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,\\nsometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups\\nin places such as the temple courts.\\n\\nNow in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a\\ncommon language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin\\nwas spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would\\nmake sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common\\nlanguage and not necessarily Latin.\\n\\nNaturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common\\nlanguage.  In the first century church, there were probably many people\\nin the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the\\nmessage for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don\\'t\\nsee people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called\\nPentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --\\nbi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -\\nsometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet\\ntogether on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don\\'t speak\\nEnglish from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their\\nnative tongue.  Neat idea, huh?\\n\\nNow, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,\\nso sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-\\nspeaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their\\nnative language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times\\nduring the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone\\nwho speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also\\nspeak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those\\nmeetings.\\n\\nAs for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch\\nwith their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep\\nfriendships among their church relationships with people of many various\\nnationalities.  \\n\\n>Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action?\\n\\nThe action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of\\nLatin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second\\nclipping of your article.\\n\\nHowever, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a\\nculture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.\\n\\n>Rather I believe it has been enhanced, for Paul exhorts us to become as\\n>one of them that we might reach them. Thus, if a person or group of\\n>people feel more comfortable \"among their own\", shall we not give them a\\n>place where they can feel comfortable [with their heritage] and still\\n>l[ove God?] {[my guess - Aaron]}\\n\\nYou have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud\\nof their cultural heritages when most denominations didn\\'t.  Yet you have\\nlargely isolated yourselves from having quality \"Christian\" friendships\\noutside your nationality (and your denomination).\\n\\nWe shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their\\nheritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church\\nunity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.\\n\\n>This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. \\n\\nIt sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going\\nabout things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist\\nEpiscopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.\\n\\nI understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such\\ngroups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it\\'s\\nhard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one\\nbody of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to\\nmake it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,\\nwould be taking the word \"African\" out of your denomination\\'s name.  Then\\nperhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the \"Methodist\\nEpiscopal\" part also, and simply be part of \"the Church\".\\n\\n>With regard to inclusivity, I note tht your .sig emits from MIT.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\\nJewish scriptures.\\n\\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\\n\\n\\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\\n\\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\\n\\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\\n\\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\\nHebrew! :-)\\n\\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \\n\\n\\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\\n\\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\\n\\n\\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\\n\\t-- and Jonathan, Saul\\'s son, loved David intensely\\n\\n\\t[ I\\'m using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\\n\\t  don\\'t yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\\n\\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\\ntranslator goes!)\\n-- \\nMichael L.

On\\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation\\'s\\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation\\'s\\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\\n\\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\\n      not barricaded or don\\'t have proper lighting.\\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\\n      levels of stress.\\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\\n      growing lack of support services for people who don\\'t have\\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\\n      The \"quality\" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\\n\\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\\nprotections for public employees.\\n   \"More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\\ncoverage for public employees,\" said McEntee.  \"This, despite the\\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.\"\\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\\nsevere.\\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\\nhave no OSHA coverage.\\n -30-\\n--\\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\\n416-629-7000/629-7044\\n',\n",

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\\nÿ\\n',\n",

See below.\\n#\\n#>>At this point the objectivist may talk of \\'self-evident truths\\'\\n# \\n#Pretty perceptive, that Prof. Flew.\\n# \\n#>>but can he deny the subjectivist\\'s claim that self-evidence is in the\\n#>>mind of the beholder?\\n# \\n#>Of course; by denying that subject/object is true dichotomy.\\n# \\n#Please explain how this helps.  I don\\'t see your argument.\\n\\nI don\\'t see yours.  It seems to rest on the assertion that everything\\nis either a subject or an object.  There\\'s nothing compelling about that\\ndichotomy.  I might just as well divide the world into subject,object,\\nevent.  It even seems more sensible.  Causation, for example, is\\nan event, not a subject or an object.  \\n\\nFurthermore, if subject/object were true dichotomy, i.e.\\n\\n\\tEverything is either a subject or an object\\n\\nThen, is that statement a self-evident truth or not?  If so, then it\\'s \\nall in the mind of the beholder, according to the relativist, and hardly \\ncompelling.  Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved\\nin its entirety into the \"subjective\" category by an idealist or \\nsolipsist argument, and that we have this perfectly good alternate\\nset of categories (subject, object, event) [which can be reduced\\nto (subject, object, quality) without any logical difficulty] and why\\nyes, I guess I *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of \\nthe beholder.\\n\\n#>>If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?\\n\\nAll of it.\\n\\n#>If nothing, then NO moral judgements are true.  This is a thing that\\n#>is commonly referred to as nihilism.  It entails that science is of\\n#>no value, irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful.  How\\n#>anyone arrives at relativism/subjectivism from this argument beats me.\\n# \\n#This makes no sense either.  Flew is arguing that this is where the\\n#objectivist winds up, not the subjectivist.  Furthermore, the nihilists\\n#believed in nothing *except* science, materialism, revolution, and the\\n#People.\\n\\nI\\'m referring to ethical nihilism\\n\\n#>>The subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are\\n#>>some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.\\n#>>To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be\\n#>>true but to have preferences regarding human activity.\"\\n# \\n#>And if those preferences should include terrorism, that moral opinion\\n#>is not true.  Likewise, if the preferences should include noTerrorism,\\n#>that moral opinion is not true.  Why should one choose a set of\\n#>preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes\\n#>noTerrorism?  Oh, no reason.  This is patently absurd....\\n# \\n#And also not the position of the subjectivist, as has been pointed out\\n#to you already by others.  Ditch the strawman, already, and see my reply\\n#to Mike Cobb\\'s root message in the thread Societal Basis for Morality.\\n\\nI\\'ve responded over there.  BTW - I don\\'t intend this as a strawman, but\\nas something logically entailed by relativism (really any ethical system\\nwhere values are assumed to be unreal).

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \\n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \\nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC\\'s National Hospital \\nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \\n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \\ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC\\'s National Center \\nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \\nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \\nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \\ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \\nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \\nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \\ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \\nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \\ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \\nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \\nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \\nof 1.96. \\n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \\nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \\nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \\nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \\nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \\nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \\n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \\nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \\ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \\nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \\nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \\npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \\n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \\nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \\nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \\nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \\n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \\n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \\ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \\nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \\ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \\n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \\nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \\ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \\n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \\ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \\nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \\ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \\ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \\nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \\nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \\n\\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \\nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \\n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \\nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \\nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \\ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \\nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \\noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \\ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \\n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \\n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \\nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \\ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \\n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \\n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \\n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \\nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \\nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \\nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \\ncharges. \\n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \\nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \\ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \\noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \\nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \\n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \\noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \\nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \\nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \\nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \\nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \\nrate. \\n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \\napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \\ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \\nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \\ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \\nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \\nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \\nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \\nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \\ndelivery (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \\nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \\namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \\nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \\ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \\n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \\nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \\nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \\nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \\n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \\navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \\nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\\nconfirmed as having malaria. \\n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \\nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \\nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \\nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \\nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \\n128 (82%) responded. \\n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \\nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \\nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \\nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \\nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \\ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \\ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \\nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \\nmalaria. \\n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \\nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \\nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \\nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \\nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \\n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \\n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \\nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \\n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \\nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \\nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \\n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \\nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \\nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \\nevening. \\n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \\nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \\nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \\nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \\nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \\n\\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \\nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \\nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \\nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \\nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \\nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \\nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \\ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \\nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \\nshort-term travelers to such areas. \\n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \\nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \\n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \\nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \\npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \\nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \\nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \\n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \\nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \\ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \\nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \\n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \\nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \\n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \\nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \\npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \\nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \\nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \\nfalciparum has not been reported. \\n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \\navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \\n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \\npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \\nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \\n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \\norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \\nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \\nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \\ninjections. \\n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \\nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \\nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \\nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \\ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \\n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \\nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \\n\\n                               ActHIB Trademark \\n\\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \\nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \\nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \\nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \\nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \\nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \\napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \\ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \\nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \\na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \\na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \\nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \\npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \\nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \\nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \\nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \\nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \\nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \\nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \\nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \\ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \\nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \\nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \\nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \\nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \\n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \\nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \\nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \\nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \\nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \\nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \\nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \\n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \\nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \\nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \\nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \\n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \\ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \\nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \\n\\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \\nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \\nprogram committee provided guidance. \\n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \\nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \\nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \\nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \\nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \\n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \\nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \\nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \\nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \\nwomen\\'s issues. \\n\\n                                Recommendations\\n\\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \\nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \\nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \\nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \\nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \\nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \\n\\n                                 Epidemiology\\n\\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \\nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \\nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \\nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \\nchildren and adolescents. \\n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \\nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \\nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \\nare appearing all the time. \\n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \\nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \\nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \\nand prognosis. \\n\\n                            Social/political Issues\\n\\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \\nfocused on changing the public\\'s attitude that AIDS is retribution for \\nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \\ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \\nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \\n\\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\\n\\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \\nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \\nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \\nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \\nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \\nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \\nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \\npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \\ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \\n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \\nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \\n\\n                               Pediatric Issues\\n\\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  With \\nearly and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of HIV-\\ninfected children has tripled.  The prevention of transmission of HIV from \\nmother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother\\'s \\nsero-status is known prior to giving birth. \\n\\n                    Periodontal and Gingival Tissue Disease\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 12\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     Oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and \\ngingivitis found in individuals with HIV infection.  Recommendations made at \\nthe workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of \\ndiagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration \\nof confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. \\n\\n                       Occupational and Treatment Issues\\n\\n     Occupational issues surrounding the treatment of HIV-infected individuals \\nand treatment rendered by HIV-infected health care professionals still command \\nconsiderable attention.  Factors under consideration include the cost/benefit \\nof HIV testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of HIV infection \\nand the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the \\ntreatment of HIV-infected patients. \\n     Conference participants anticipate that a third International Workshop on \\nthe Oral Manifestations of HIV Infection will be held in five years or less.  \\nProceedings from the second workshop will be published by the Quintessence \\nCompany in late 1993.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n--------- end of part 1 ------------\\n\\n---\\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\\n',\n",

Such \"extra-\\n>rational\" cases are curiosities -- not guides to methodology.\\n\\nAs has been noted before, there is the distinction between _motivation_\\nand _method_.  No experimental result should be accepted unless it is\\ndescribed in sufficient detail to be replicated, and the replications\\ndo indeed reproduce the result.  No theoretical argument should be\\naccepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed, and\\nreasonable, knowlegeable, people agree with the force of the logic.\\n\\nBut people try experiments, and pursue arguments, for all sorts of crazy\\nreasons.  Irrational motivations are not just curiousities; they are a\\nlarge part of the history of science.\\n\\nThere are a couple of negative points to make here:\\n\\n1) A theory of qi could, conceivably, become accepted without direct\\nverification of the existence of qi.  For example, quarks are an accepted\\npart of the standard model of physics, with no direct verification.  What\\nwould be needed would be a theory, based on qi, that predicted medical\\nreality better than the alternatives.  The central theoretical claim could\\nlie forever beyond experiment, as long as there was a sufficient body of\\nexperimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other.\\n\\n(I wouldn\\'t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi, though.\\nI don\\'t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it, much less\\na theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology.  And it\\nis hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather\\ndirectly verifying the existence of qi.)\\n\\n2) Science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational\\nexperiment-data-theory sequence.  Most experiments are carried out, and\\ninterpreted, in pre-existing theoretical frameworks.  The theoretical\\ncontroversies of the day determine which experiments get done.  Overall,\\nthere is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies, crazy motivations,\\npetty hatreds, and the like that determines which experiments, and which\\ncomputations, get done.  What keeps it going forward is the critical\\nfunction of science: results don\\'t count unless they can be replicated.\\n\\nThe whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate-and-test.  The generate\\npart can be totally irrational, as long as the test part works properly.\\n\\nPasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals;\\nbut even Mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed;\\nthat when you separate them by handedness, you get two chemicals that rotate\\npolarized light in opposite directions; and the right-rotating version was\\nindistinguishable from tartaric acid.  Pasteur\\'s irrational motivation had\\nled to a replicable, and important, result.\\n\\nThis is where Lysenko, creationists, etc. fail.  They have usually not\\neven produced coherent theories that predict much of anything.  When their\\ntheories do predict, and are contradicted by experiment, they do not\\nconcede the point and modify their theories; rather they try to suppress\\nthe results (Lysenko) or try to divert attention to other evidence they\\nthink supports their position (creationists).\\n-- \\nMark A.

When one person must die if he is to save\\nanother, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable?  \\nThat leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, \\nespecially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable,\\nthe serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line,\\nthose two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be\\nable to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial\\nkiller has restricted some people\\'s life and/or liberty, but is not his\\nown life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence,\\nit is.\\n\\n>>>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.  And, I thought I had\\n>>>defined murder as an intentional killing of a non-murderer, against his will.\\n\\nOooh, I like that.  It means that killing an infant is not murder because\\nit cannot be against its will.  Reason, an infant has no will as such.\\n\\nSimilarly for people who are brain dead (easier to see), in a coma, etc.\\n\\nAlso, under current law, accidental killing is still murder.  How will you\\ninclude that?\\n\\n>>>And you responded to this by asking whether or not the execution of an\\n>>>innocent person under our system of capital punishment was a murder or not.\\n>>>I fail to see what this has to do with anything.  I never claimed that our\\n>>>system of morality was an objective one.\\n>>I thought that was your very first claim.   That there was\\n>>some kind of \"objective\" morality, and that an example of that was\\n>>that murder is wrong.   If you don\\'t want to claim that any more,\\n>>that\\'s fine.\\n\\nThe only real golden rule in life is, he who has the gold, makes the\\nrules.  I.e. Might Makes Right.  That is survival.  Now what is wrong\\nwith that?\\n\\n>Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most\\n>every moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system\\n>and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.

I agree that arrogance is not the result\\nof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if\\nyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one\\'s\\nsuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person\\'s beliefs.\\n\\nI need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall\\ninto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area\\nI hope you will forgive me.\\n\\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\\none\\'s God is greater than the god\\'s of others or of believing that one\\'s\\nreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied\\nbeliefs.\\n\\nIt is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.\\nWere I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow\\nwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\\ncorrect.  That\\'s not arrogance.  That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\\nI have been so unthankful.  You\\'ve given me power to resist the devil.  I\\nhave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said\\nnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself\\nwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you\\'ve given me, I have been\\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I\\'ve led.  Lord,\\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I\\'m so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil\\'s aim is to get us\\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\\nhot irons.

Our agency started to express interest in\\n|> virtual reality(VR).  So far, we do not know much about VR.  All we\\n|> know about are the Hollywood movies \"The Terminater 2\" and \"Lawnmover\\n|> Man\".  We also know something about VR from ABC news magazine and\\n|> Computer Graphics World magazine.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n|> \\n|> We certainly want to know more about VR.  Who are the leading\\n|> companies,\\n|> agencies, universities?  What machines support VR (i.e. SGI, Sun4,\\n|> HP-9000, BIM-6000, etc.)?\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI\\'s uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n|>  What kind of graphics languages are used with VR\\n|> (GL, opengl, Phigs, PEX, GKS, etc.)?\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

It may be the Holy Spirit's\\nway of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that\\nwe can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a \\npure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy\\neven when he dreams.\\n\\nDreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples\\nof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  \\n\\nRegarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be\\ncareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially\\nif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.\\nChristians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate\\nan out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE\\nmight actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.\\nIn II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught\\nup into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really\\nleave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a\\nspirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters\\nthat much.  Paul could not tell.  \\n\\nBe that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan\\nto experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a \\nplace until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If\\nGod wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His\\nown sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are\\njust taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking\\nan OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was\\ncaught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some\\nJewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one\\ntime.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it.\\nPeople should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits\\nfor the sake of a few thrills.\\n\\nLink Hudson.\\n\",\n",

This\\n>also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of\\n>David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as\\n>well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ\\'s LEGAL FATHER.\\n\\nThe argument for Luke\\'s genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According\\nto Luke 3:23\\n\\n   And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about \\n   thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph,\\n   the son of Eli,\\n\\nAside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible\\ninterpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother.\\nClearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son\\nof Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man\\nto whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at\\nstraws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no\\nintention of tracing Mary\\'s genealogy (in which case he would have\\nnamed her) but that he traces her husband\\'s, from David\\'s son Nathan.\\n\\nThe Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David\\'s\\nson, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:\\n\\n   And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born\\n   Jesus, who is called Christ. \\n\\nThere are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the\\ntwo paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David,\\nSolomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph\\nrelavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was\\nnot Jesus\\'s physical father, then the original poster is quite\\ncorrect, that claims for Jesus\\'s messianic heritage are not based on\\ntruth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus\\'s divine nature was.\\n\\nThe second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not\\ninvolved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy\\nSpirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also\\ncapable of employing the physical agency of Joseph\\'s seed in this\\nwork.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss\\nsolely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of\\npurity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that\\nneither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they\\nhad not \"known\"each other).  Thus the first gospel\\'s dedication of\\nhalf its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant\\nto Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.\\n\\nTo the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more\\nproblems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating \\nthe births of two entirely different children of two entirely different\\nsets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and \\nthe birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two \\nstories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years\\nlater with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his\\nexplanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge\\nwith their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his\\nresolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external\\ndocuments, and the discussion of \"how this could be\" might bring us beyond\\nthe limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the\\ndetails are described in Steiner\\'s \"The Spiritual Guidance of the Human \\nBeing and of Humanity\", \"The Gospel of St. Luke\", and \"The Gospel of St.\\nMatthew\". \\n\\nWhether or not Rudolf Steiner\\'s methods and explanation are accepted\\nas valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent\\ncontradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.\\n\\nAs for the passing of one\\'s Jewishness through the mother, this was\\nnever an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary\\'s\\nJewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal\\nline of descent from David, the king.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

Aside from the book of\\nDaniel, the whole OT predates Alexander (the Great).  These books were written\\n(predominantly) in Hebrew.\\n\\tThere were also other books being written at about this time and later\\nby Greek-speaking, or \"Hellenistic\", Jews.  These books are those which are\\nreckoned by many denominations as \"Apocrypha\".\\n\\tBefore the closing of the Writings, the third part of what is today\\ncalled the canon, all of the books were in use by Jews of the day.  However,\\nthere were those who reckoned (based on Zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased.\\nThis faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day.  They\\nalso maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine\\nteachings from God.\\n\\tBy the time of c.65 CE, another faction had entered the mess.  Christians\\nhad come in claiming that THEIR writings were also suitable to be read in\\nsynagogues and used for worship.  Therefore, the Palestinian Jewish leaders\\ngot together and stated that the books written from the time of Ben Sira (Sirach)\\nonward were not sacred writings.  They justified this from Zech. 13.  In\\nparticular, they said, the writings of the Christians (called heretics) were\\nnot inspired.\\n\\tAt about 90 CE, they codified things further by closing the canon in\\nsomewhat of an official sense at the Council of Jamnia.  A few books (Ecclesi-\\nastes, Song of Songs, Esther) made it in after that date, but these were those\\nwhich had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of Ben\\nSira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the Christian\\nand Hellenistic writings.\\n\\tJerome excluded the \\'apocrypha\\' because they were not in use by Jews\\nof his day and because they were (except for Sirach) not found in Hebrew in his\\ntime.  His criterion for separating them from the other pre-Christian writings\\nwas not based on \\'inspiration\\'.\\n\\n\\tThere is plenty more to say, but I do not have time.\\n\\tThe passage you quote concerns the book (Rev.) in which it is found.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFrank D.\\n',\n",

For\\nexample, Why couldn\\'t Magellan just be told to go into a \"safe\"\\nmode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if\\nmaybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy\\ngets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  \\n\\nFor that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments\\n\"turned off\" rather than just \"safed\".  Was it political (i.e.\\nas along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging\\ncongress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky\\nscientists out of the bureaucrat\\'s hair....  \\n\\nI\\'ve heard the argument that an active but \"uncontrolled\"\\nspacecraft causes \"radio noise.\"  I find that hard to believe\\nthat this could be a problem in a properly designed \"safe\" mode.\\nThis safe mode could be a program routine which causes the\\nspacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a\\n(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.\\nAt that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can\\ncontinue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to\\nthe safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the\\nspacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be\\nprepared if necessary.  \\n\\nAs another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is\\nbeam stored data towards Earth.

On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\\nuseful payload to orbit.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

IMHO the wider meaning is not\\n:  obsolete at all, no matter how much the lay press would like it to\\n:  be!  [....]\\n\\n:  Therefore I conclude that if you call yourself a hacker, and somebody\\n:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very\\n:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know\\n:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]\\n\\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \\'hacker\\'\\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, know what \\'hacker\\' means from those who consider\\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\\n\\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \\'a UNIX\\n     hacker\\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  See {cracker}.\\n\\n     The term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\\n     project.\\n\\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  So,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (This means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\\nto communicate.

COBE has\\nmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large\\nangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.\\n     But to illuminate SIRTF\\'s potential, Jim Evans, JPL\\'s\\nmanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,\\nrecently said that the project is \"1,000 to 1 million times more\\ncapable than IRAS,\" based on technological advances in infrared\\ndetector arrays.\\n     However, despite the enormous strides in infrared\\nexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the\\nhighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s\\n(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a \"diet or die\"\\ndirective from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project\\ngoing, according to Werner.\\n     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key\\nfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the sun\\ninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket\\nlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. \"The\\nmain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your\\nlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don\\'t have to\\ncarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit,\" Werner said.\\nThe other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that \"it\\'s in a\\nbetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth.\"\\n     Additional major changes in SIRTF\\'s redesign include\\nshortening the mission from five to three years and building a\\nspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original\\nplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)\\ncompared to Titan SIRTF\\'s 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).\\n     All of that adds up to \"a less stressful launch\\nenvironment,\" Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200\\nmillion for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the\\ndesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.\\n     Werner said SIRTF\\'s redesign came as a result of Congress\\'\\ntelling NASA \"you\\'re trying to do too many things. If you want us\\nto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see\\nhow it fits into (NASA\\'s) overall strategy.\"\\n     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA\\'s highest\\npriority \"flagship\" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary\\nSpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing\\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences.\\n     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping\\nto keep the project alive, SIRTF\\'s major scientific contribution\\nalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector\\narrays, which will allow images to be developed \"tens of\\nthousands of times faster\" than before, according to Evans.\\n     \"Up until a couple of years ago,\" Werner said, \"all infrared\\nastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays\\nof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department\\nof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or\\nhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and\\nthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF.\"\\n     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget\\npressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an\\neye out for any \"technological spinoff.\"\\n     \"On that question, I think we have some things to say,\" he\\nsaid, \"because the detectors we\\'re using are straight off various\\nmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.\\naerospace industry, and it\\'s a real technological and engineering\\nchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.\\n     \"SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,\"\\nWerner added, but the revised three-year mission \"puts a premium\\non observing time. We have to educate the user community and\\ndevelop a program that involves early surveys and quick\\nturnaround of the data.\"\\n     Werner said the downsizing of the project required a\\nreduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF\\'s three instruments --\\nthe infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband\\nimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in\\nlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.\\n     The project hopes to start a \"Phase B\" activity in 1995,\\nwhich will provide a detailed concept for development and design.\\nBuilding the hardware would begin about two years later.\\n     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950\\nmillion.\\n     \"I am very optimistic about SIRTF,\" he said. \"It will\\nprovide a tremendous return for the investment.\"\\n     Werner added that an additional benefit from the project\\nwill be the \"enrichment of our intellectual and cultural\\nenvironment. People on the street are very interested in\\nastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other\\nplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of\\nquestions SIRTF will help answer.\"\\n                              ###\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

What\\'s up?\\n| \\n| This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes\\n| months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly.\\n| Basically it\\'s because the Law was given to Moses as part of a\\n| specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren\\'t Jews, so we\\n| aren\\'t part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in\\n| Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to\\n| Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this\\n| debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but\\n| keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles\\n| concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians,\\n| and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.\\n\\n1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom\\n4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only\\ndid sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it\\nwas revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).\\n\\n2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise\\nwhich undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the\\npeople, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised\\n\"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is\\nbased on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law\\nGod promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their\\nhearts\" (Heb. 8:10).\\n\\n3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The\\nSabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt\\nhad been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been\\neven more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly\\nSabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at\\nany time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was\\n*added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).\\n\\n4.  Israel stands for God\\'s people of all time.  That is why God *grafted*\\nthe Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the\\ncovenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises\\nbelong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born\\ninto Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of\\nIsrael\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ\\'s, then are ye\\nAbraham\\'s seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are\\nAbraham\\'s seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the\\ncriterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the\\npromise God made to all his people the Israelites.\\n\\n| \\n| While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us,\\n| because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews,\\n| we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected\\n| from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it\\'s the\\n| same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this.\\n| \\n| These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments\\n| into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to\\n| the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are\\n| thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to\\n| everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except\\n| for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take\\n| this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on\\n| the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to\\n| worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians\\n| are free to choose the specific time we worship.\\n\\nPeople would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath\\ncommandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the\\nceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even\\nif you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan\\nsun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed,\\nsanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders\\nagree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in\\nsoc.religion.christian.bible-study).\\n| \\n| A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin\\n| and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer\\n| binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior\\n| should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still\\n| useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally\\n| binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not\\n| believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While\\n| we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it\\'s not safe for us to go\\n| into situations with no principles to guide us.  We\\'re too good at\\n| self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral\\n| guidance, from things like Jesus\\' teachings, Paul\\'s advice, etc.\\n| These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same\\n| function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in\\n| the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed\\n| legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that\\n| given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important.\\n| \\nI do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God\\nsays.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law,\\nwhy is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the\\nSabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important\\nenough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that\\nthe message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but\\nfreed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in\\ncourt I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me\\ngrace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I\\nam now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed\\nlimit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through\\nfaith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is\\nholy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).\\n\\n| In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of\\n| tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ\\'s\\n| resurrection.  There\\'s some debate about what Acts shows about early\\n| Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish\\n| Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but\\n| that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then.\\n| Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also\\n| implies gatherings on that day.\\n| \\n| There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to\\n| worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day\\n| Adventists and Jehovah\\'s Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a\\n| regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and\\n| that I Cor 16:2 doesn\\'t explicitly say it\\'s a regular worship service.\\n\\nDo you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows\\nthat the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did\\nnot go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to\\nAssos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\"\\nwith \"go to a worship service.\"\\n| \\n| It\\'s clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul\\'s time.  See\\n| Rom 14:5.  Paul\\'s advice is that we should be very careful about\\n| judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific\\n| day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that\\n| specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his\\n| worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the\\n| Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue\\n| that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col\\n| 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly\\n| mentions Sabbath.)\\n\\nWrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath\\nday of the moral law.\\n| \\n| There are some differences among Christians about use of the word\\n| \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish\\n| day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the\\n| day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply\\n| the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering\\n| schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It\\n| distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated\\n| for Jews, and the Lord\\'s Day -- which is the free Christian worship.\\n| (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There\\n| are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians\\n| support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside\\n| that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical\\n| anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish\\n| Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the\\n| Lord\\'s Day.\\n| \\nWhy would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments\\nwhich conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a\\nGod who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could\\nnot be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a\\nbroken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law\\nbreaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to\\nfollow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to\\nmake false gods, to violate God\\'s name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to\\nkill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight\\nwhen placed next to the word of God.\\n\\nDarius\\n\\n[It\\'s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I\\nthink Paul\\'s comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is\\nprobably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing\\nwhat he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally\\naccept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing\\ntheir best to honor the Lord.\\n\\nHowever I\\'d like to be clear that I do not think there\\'s unambiguous\\nproof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I\\nindicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.\\n\\nThe difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually\\nabout something else.  They both look like they are talking about\\nnnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they\\ngathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of\\ninformation, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  \\n\\nAct 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple\\nworship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the\\ntemple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of\\nChristians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn\\'t tell us\\nwhat day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius\\'\\nconfusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no\\nreason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the\\nBiblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to\\nme that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn\\'t say they gathered to\\nsee Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread,\\nPaul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that\\'s just not explicit\\nenough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says\\nthat on the first day they should set aside money for Paul\\'s\\ncollection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially\\nto do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can\\'t disprove it,\\nbut the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be\\nwhen they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do\\nit in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day.\\nSo I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day\\nof every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.  \\n\\nI think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements\\nis that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian\\nworship was.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Which is it?\\n\\nThe first part of the second statement contains no information, because\\nyou don\\'t say what \"the beliefs\" are.  If \"the beliefs\" are strong theism \\nand/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The\\nsecond part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\\naxiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\\nassumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\\nused to obtain it.\\n\\n|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\\n|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\\n\\nI can\\'t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?

I\\'m not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx\\nin advance)\\n\\nI want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There\\nis this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says:\\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\\n\\n[I\\'m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\\nof the translation.  It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it\\'s not any edition\\nthat\\'s widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It\\'s been alleged that a few\\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\\ninconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there\\nare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,\\nI\\'m afraid.)\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

The founder of this\\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\\n\\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\\n\\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect\\'s\\ninternal resources.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal religion.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================\\n\\n        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will\\nofficially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If\\nthe group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  \"YES/Create\"  votes\\nthan  \"NO/don\\'t  create\"  votes;  the group shall be created.

Bede is a great\\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\\nnot make it more so.\\n\\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\\nFestival.\"\\n\\nHowever, Bede\\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\\n\\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was\\nreferred to simply as \"albae.\" Translaters rendering this into\\nGerman mistook it for the plural of \"alba,\" meaning \"dawn.\" They\\naccordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for\\n\"dawn.\" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n\\n\\n[No, I\\'m not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety\\nof celebrating Easter.

L. \\nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \\nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \\nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \\nbulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are \\nmuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told \\nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \\ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn\\'t \\ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \\nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \\nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \\naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \\nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \\nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \\nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I\\'m not ready to buy that yet.  I do \\nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \\ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \\ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \\nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \\nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \\ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \\npH to basically starve the candida out.\\n\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

While it holds PARTICULAR\\ninterest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain\\nfrom discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity\\nhas been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental\\nhold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. \\nThis was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in\\nslave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It\\nwasn\\'t enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your\\nGOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be\\nworshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are\\nthese icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in\\nEuropean countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical\\nphysical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool,\\nHis feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all\\nBiblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this\\nimportant topic; flamers need not reply.\\n\\nSherlette \\n\\nP.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  \"It doesn\\'t matter what\\ncolor His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts.\"\\n This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3\\ndecades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for\\nsaying that \"it doesn\\'t matter...\"  to a member of a physically emancipated\\npeople who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT\\nMATTERS.\\n\\n[The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified.\\nThere has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can\\'t discuss\\neverything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn\\'t been\\ndiscussed recently shouldn\\'t be taken as a sign of general cowardice,\\narrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by\\nsuggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a\\nfew scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic.\\nAs you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in\\nart tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn\\'t be\\nsurprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art\\nshowing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian\\ndevotion to think of him in such a way.  It\\'s also good now and then\\nto have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member\\nof XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh]\\n',\n",

The other startling fact is the\\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\\nunoccupied and available for building.

Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no \\n\\t   demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.\\n\\n\\t2. Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid \\n\\t   function for the purpose of quick weight loss.\\n\\n\\t3. Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has \\n\\t   been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by \\n\\t   the NCI.\\n\\nThese are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should \\nnot committ but sometimes do.  There are also errors of omission(some of \\nwhich result in malpractice suits).  I don\\'t think that using anti-fungal \\nagents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be \\nhaving a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of \\ncommission or omission.  Healers have had a long history of trying to \\nrelieve human suffering.  Some have stuck to standard, approved procedures,\\nothers have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a \\nchance that it will help the patient.  The key has to be tied to the \\nhealer\\'s oath, \"I will do no harm\".  But you know David that very few \\ntreatments involve no risk to the patient.  The job of the physician is a \\nvery difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed.  Each \\nphysician deals with this risk/benefit paradox a little differently.  Some \\nare very conservative while others are more agressive.  An agressive \\napproach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long \\nas the motive is improving the patient\\'s health and not an attempt to rake \\nin lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in \\nthe medicare fraud cases), I don\\'t see the need to label these healers as \\nquacks or even unethical.\\n\\nWhat do I reserve the term quack for?  Pseudo-medical professionals.  \\nThese people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the \\nfrustrated patient to fall into their lair.  Some of these individuals are \\nreally doing a pretty good job of providing \"alternative\" medicine.  But \\nmany lack any formal training and are in the \"business\" simply to make a \\nfew fast bucks.   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting \\ncompetent care when a liscenced physician is consulted, this alternative \\ncare area is really a buyer\\'s beware arena.  If you are lucky, you may find \\nsomeone who can help you.  If you are unlucky, you can loose a lot of \\nmoney and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo-\\nmedical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the \\nliscened physicians).\\n\\nI hope that this clears things up David.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n',\n",

No, the other car\\njust does not crank well.  Now, the engine might stall because the idle\\nwas too low to start with. When the extra current is drawn, the idle speed\\nwill drop - as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the\\nincreased amperage requirement.\\n\\n: >Is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company, the fcc, or both?\\n: \\n: Ultimately it\\'s likely to be your problem to resolve, I\\'m afraid.  The\\n: FCC is so understaffed that they don\\'t pay much attention to citizen\\n: complains about RFI (or so I\\'ve heard)... they\\'ll just send you a\\n: pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures.\\n: \\n: Talking to the power company might help - they might be able to install\\n: filtering devices at your service panel (or recommend a type which you\\n: could have installed by a licensed electrician).\\n\\nA transmitter is not going to be affecting house power. If surges are\\noccurring there, it is due to another cause - not a transmitter.\\n\\n: Unfortunately, there\\'s a fair chance that enough signal is being picked\\n: up by your house wiring that a simple service-panel filter won\\'t\\n: suffice.  You may need to install heavy-duty RFI filters at the power\\n: connections of your affected equipment.\\n\\nIt is probably not that much of a problem. Often - toroid coils on the\\npower leads will solve that part of the interference problem. It will\\nnot solve internal equipment deficiencies.\\n\\n: If the problem occurs regularly, you may need to \"stake out\" the street\\n: in question, and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by\\n: at the time interference occurs.  If you can identify the vehicle which\\n: is transmitting, you may be able to contact its owner and complain.\\n\\nIt is probably not the transmitter that is at fault. If the person is an\\namateur, then he/she will probably be willing to help - if you explain\\nthat the person is causing interference.\\n\\nBill\\n',\n",

He had me stop the Mevicore to allow the liver to heal (\"Just\\nto be extra cautious, though I\\'m sure it\\'s not a problem.\"),\\nand wants me to go back on it after that.

If you really want to find out\\nwhy we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try\\npraying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians\\nabout their experiences personally.

Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\\n\\nCommon references for audio are:\\n\\n\\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\\n\\t0 dBV = 1 volt\\n\\n\\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\\n\\t0 VU = -10dBV\\t(consumer gear line level)\\n\\n\\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\\nor moment.\\n\\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\\npower will also increase the same amount.

In addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-\\nantibody complexes to  CD4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific \\nactivation  of CD4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  \\nmay contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV infection.  The absence of CD4 \\nbinding by the MicroGeneSys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added \\nsafety feature.  Phase I studies have  demonstrated stable CD4 counts, \\nstimulation of cytotoxic T cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune \\nfunction.

Death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the \\nmedical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of HIV disease or drug \\nabuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  \\nThere were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  \\nwere deceased.

In the Lancet\\'s March 13 issue, Schechter et al. call Duesberg\\'s  \\nhypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  AZT lead to \\nAIDS, \"a hindrance to public health initiatives.\"   However, their hypothesis \\nthat HIV is the cause of AIDS has not  attained any public health benefits.  \\nThe U.S. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, \\nno prevention,  and no AIDS control have resulted from work on this \\nhypothesis.   Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \\ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \\nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \\nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg\\'s drug-\\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \\nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg\\'s hypothesis Schechter would  have to \\nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \\nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \\nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.

Pugliese Hospital in Catanzaro, Italy.  \\nThe researchers report  three asymptomatic HIV-1 infected individuals with \\nhepatitis C  Virus related chronic active hepatitis (CAH) who had a rapid,  \\nprofound decline of CD4 cells after IFN.  All three patients  throughout the \\nobservation were consistently negative for serum  HIV p24 antigen and had \\ncirculating antibodies to p24.  Sera from all three patients, obtained at the \\nend of IFN treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, \\ncontained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  \\naminoterminal of the beta chain of all human HLA class II  antigens, \\nhomologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of HIV-1 gp41.  \\nThese autoantibodies, which also  recognize \"native\" class II molecules and \\nmay contribute to the  elimination of CD4 T cells \"in vivo\", were at low tires \\n(50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping IFN.  Such  \\nautoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with HIV  infection and \\nHCV related CAH treated with IFN and who did not  experience CD4 T-cell loss \\nin some HIV-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful \\n\"autoimmune\" reactions.  The subjects had A1; B8; DR3; and B35, DR1 HLA \\nantigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in CD4 cell \\ncounts and  clinical progression of HIV-1 disease.  IFN can induce a very  \\nrapid decline of CD4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with \\nthese HLA haplotypes, the researchers conclude. \\n       ================================================================   \\n                                April 23, 1993 \\n       ================================================================    \\n\"TB Makes a Comeback\" State Government News (04/93) Vol. 36, No. 4, P. 6   \\n(Voit, William and Knapp, Elaine S.) \\n\\n     Although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  United \\nStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, \\nminorities, and prisoners.

According to \\nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \\ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \\nresidents don\\'t  complete therapy.

Smith.  The introduction is written by\\nPaul Kurtz. \\n\\n\\tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\n\\t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of\\n\\tthe world\\'s fastest growing religions, with as many as\\n\\t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\\'s\\n\\taggressive missionary program, covering more than one\\n\\thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world\\n\\tcountries.\\n\\t\\n\\tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and\\n\\tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict\\n\\tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly\\n\\treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of\\n\\ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief\\n\\tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion,\\n\\tpornography, sexual freedom, women\\'s rights, and other, in\\n\\tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it\\n\\tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.\\n\\t\\n\\tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy\\n\\tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western\\n\\tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\\n\\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\\n\\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\\n\\tgovernment officials.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\\n\\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\\n\\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\\n\\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\\n\\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written \"by\\n\\tthe commandment of God,\" claims that the ancient Hebrews\\n\\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\\n\\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\\n\\thave been baptized in the \"true church\" will be reunited\\n\\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\\n\\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\\n\\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\\n\\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\\n\\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.\\n\\t\\n\\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\\n\\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\\n\\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\\n\\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\\n\\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\\n\\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\\n\\tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\\n\\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \\n\\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\\n\\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\\n\\tin nineteenth-century America.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --\\n\\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\\n\\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\\n\\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\\n\\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\\n\\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\\n\\tis dangerous to the faith.\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\\n\\tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\\n\\tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical\\n\\texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion\\n\\tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a\\n\\tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the\\n\\thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz\\n\\t\\n\\nThe article itself is super.\\n\\n  ,...,.,,\\n /666;    \\',    \\n////;    _~ -   \\n(/@/----0-~-0\\n ;\\'  . `` ~ \\\\\\'\\n  , `    \\' , >\\n;;|\\\\..((   -C---->> jimtims p00168@psilink.com \\n;;| >-  `.__),;;\\n\\n',\n",

This time we not only scored \\nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \\nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \\nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \\nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \\na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \\nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \\ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \\nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \\nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \\ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \\n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \\nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \\nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \\nher for an entertaining evening.\\n\\n\\n\\nANNUAL MEETING\\n\\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \\nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \\nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \\npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \\nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \\nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \\nyear term.

Therefore, in addition \\nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \\nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \\nmembers and there is plenty of work. \\n\\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \\ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \\nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\\n\\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \\nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\\n\\nFUTURE MEETINGS\\n\\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \\n\\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\\n\\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \\n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \\n\\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\\n\\nNOTDAW\\n\\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \\nAwareness Week.

It is, however, closely regulated. In order to \\npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\\none of the following:\\na) An employee of a government agency.\\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \\nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\\n\\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \\norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \\nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \\n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\\n\\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\\n\\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\'\\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \\n\\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\\nC, for details.\\n\\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\\n\\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\\n\\n>And no, I\\'m not going to even think of buying one.  I\\'m not that crazy.\\n\\nWhy not? It\\'s a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets\\nfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything\\nbigger) rocket hobbies.

Who is he? \\n>Please do not answer with \"A well known evolutionist\" or some other such\\n>informationless phrase.\\n\\n   Francis Hitching is the author of, among other books,\\n_The Neck of the Giraffe_.\" He believes evolution is\\ndirected by some sort of cosmic force, but does not like\\nDarwinism.  He wrote in this book [ _The Neck of the\\nGiraffe_, Ticknor & Fields, New Haven, Connecticut, 1982,\\np. 12 (p. 4, paperback)] that:\\n\\n   For all its acceptance in the scientific world as the\\n   great unifying principle of biology, Darwinism, after\\n   a century and a quarter, is in a surprising amount of\\n   trouble.  Evolution and Darwinism are often taken to\\n   mean the same thing.  But they don\\'t.  Evolution of\\n   life over a very long period of time is a fact, if we\\n   are to believe evidence gathered during the last two\\n   centuries from geology, paleontology, molecular biol-\\n   ogy and many other scientific disciplines.  Despite\\n   the many believers in Divine creation who dispute this\\n   ..., the probability that evolution has occurred\\n   approaches certainty in scientific terms....  On the\\n   other hand Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism, its modern\\n   version) is a theory that seeks to explain evolution.\\n   It has not, contrary to general belief, and despite\\n   very great efforts, been proved.\\n\\n   Research on Hitching turned up the following: Hitching is\\nbasically a sensational TV script writer and has no scien-\\ntific credentials.  In _The Neck of the Giraffe_ he claimed\\nto be a member of the Royal Archaeological Institute, but an\\ninquiry to that institute said he was not.  He implied in\\nthe \"Acknowledgements\" of _The Neck of the Giraffe_ that\\npaleontologist Stephen Jay Gould had helped in the writing\\nof the book, but upon inquiry Gould said he did not know him\\nand had no information about him.  Hitching also implied\\nthat his book had been endorsed by Richard Dawkins, but upon\\ninquiry Dawkins stated: \"I know nothing at all about Francis\\nHitching.  If you are uncovering the fact that he is a char-\\nlatan, good for you.  His book, _The Neck of the Giraffe,_\\nis one of the silliest and most ignorant I have read for\\nyears.\"\\n\\n   Hitching believes in the paranormal and has written on\\nMayan pyramid energy and for some \"In Search Of...\" episodes\\non BBC television.  The reference work _Contemporary\\nAuthors,_ Vol. 103, page 208, lists him as a member of the\\nSociety for Psychical Research, the British Society of\\nDowsers and of the American Society of Dowsers.  His writ-\\nings include: _Earth Magic,_ _Dowsing: The Psi Connection,_\\n_Mysterious World: An Atlas of the Unexplained,_ _Fraud,\\nMischief, and the Supernatural_ and _Instead of Darwin_.\\n\\n   Hitching\\'s book spends much of its time attacking Dar-\\nwinian evolution, borrowing heavily and uncritically from\\nyoung-earth creationist arguments.  Many of Hitching\\'s \"ref-\\nerences\" are lifted from young-earth creationist literature\\nrather than being quoted directly from their original\\nsources.  One magazine had this to say [_Creation/Evolution\\nNewsletter_, 7, No. 5, pp. 15-16, September/October 1987]:\\n\\n   Speaking of the Biblical Creation Society, there was\\n   an interesting letter in the January 1983 issue of\\n   their journal Biblical Creation (p. 74) concerning a\\n   review of Francis Hitching\\'s 1982 book _The Neck of\\n   the Giraffe_.  Hitching\\'s book is strongly anti-\\n   Darwinist, and is enthusiastically hailed by most cre-\\n   ationists (though he also pokes fun at fundamentalist\\n   creationists).  The letter, by creationist Malcolm\\n   Bowden (author of _The Rise of the Evolution Fraud_),\\n   points out that Hitching simply \"culled his informa-\\n   tion from the creationist literature.\"  This is indeed\\n   the case:  many creationist works are cited favorably\\n   (Anderson, Coffin, Clark, Daly, Davidheiser, Dewar,\\n   Gish, Morris, Segraves, Whitcomb, and Wysong, plus\\n   various anti-Darwinists).  Hitching does cite Bowden\\'s\\n   earlier book _Ape-Men -- Fact or Fallacy?_, but Bowden\\n   accuses Hitching of \"lifting\" several passages and\\n   illustrations from his book without acknowledgment:\\n   in other words, plagiarism.  \"Hitchin\\'s [sic] book is\\n   largely an exposition of the creationists [sic] view-\\n   point from the beginning to almost the end,\" Bowden\\n   points out....  Hitching is also a paranormalist, an\\n   advocate of psychic evolution.... [Hitching\\'s book]\\n   _Earth Magic_ is a wild, extremely entertaining and\\n   thoroughly psychic interpretation of megalithic struc-\\n   tures....  Hitching also includes in his scheme cosmic\\n   cataclysms, Atlantis, pyramidology, dowsing, ESP,\\n   miraculous healing, and astrology.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAlan Feuerbacher\\nalanf@atlas.pen.tek.com\\n\\n',\n",

But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists\\nhave historically not been too successfull in finding the\\ndistance of any object by proving that there is only one\\npossible way in which the object can work, and therefore\\nit *must* be so-and-so.\\n\\nRalph Wijers\\n\\n',\n",

My comments are based\\nprimarily on William Rusch\\'s historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\\nControversy\", Fortress.  I\\'m going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\\n\\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\\n \\n[SECOND CENTURY\\n\\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\\nThus Jesus\\' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\\n\\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus\\' views should\\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\\n\\n\\nTHIRD CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nDynamic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Theodotus\\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\\nconsubstantial with the Father\\'s divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\\nsense of the word.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\\n\\'diversity\\' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\\na hypostatic union.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\\nwithout beginning or end.\\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\\ndoctrine of salvation.\\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\\nChurch.  --clh]\\n\\n \\nModalistic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Praxeas\\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\\n(Jesus Only)\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God\\'s modalistic manifesting\\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\\nthe only unique and unitary God\\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\\nregeneration and sanctification.\\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ\\'s baptism.\\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\\n \\n[I\\'ve moved the following description to be with the other\\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\\n\\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\\n\\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\\nthrough the Son.  Origen\\'s intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\\n\\n\\nFOURTH CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\\n \\nSource: Arius\\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and several other lesser known\\ncults\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The inherent oneness of God\\'s nature is properly\\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\\nhe is not of the divine essence.\\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\\n \\nOrthodox Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Athanasius\\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: God\\'s being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\\neternal.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\\nthe divine essence and function.\\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen\\'s thought a bit\\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen\\'s, and it was hard\\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\\nmust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council\\nof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of\\nthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]\\n\\nAdapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8\\nbit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this.

You don't seem\\nto have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the\\nnext. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one\\nthrough.\\n\\n>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?\\n\\n>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\\n>designed for that.\\n\\nAs I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm.

You have not proposed any workable alternatives.\\n\\n>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; \\n\\nSpeak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\\nto the 8 bit image palette.\\n\\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\\n\\n>say,\\n>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\\n>expected that the image still is the same. \\n\\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\\n\\n>So, XV were designed\\n>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\n>program work -- design error.\\n\\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\\n\\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\\n\\n>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\n>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\n>major change to the original design.\\n\\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So \\nfar, you have not done so.\\n\\n>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\\n>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\\n\\nArgh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'.

But not all of them\\ndid, which prompted an official renaming of the disease to Chronic\\nFatigue Syndrome (this renaming took place in the Annals of Internal\\nMedicine, Jan. 1988, I believe).

This is not the same thing as saying that the\\nsyndrome may have a (at least partly) psychological cause. The\\ndisagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers\\non just what the cause is. No one knows, but theories include:\\npsychological stress, some sort of virus (a retrovirus, say most --\\nmaybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses), environmental\\ntoxins, bacteria (and, yes, candida), genes, (and/)or some combo of\\nthese.\\n\\nThere\\'s no outright cure at the moment, but different docs try\\ndifferent things, some of which seem to help.\\n\\nMassive amounts of info on the condition are available these days.\\nPost your Q to alt.med.cfs, and you will be flooded w/facts.\\n\\nNote: There are lots of far better understood (and better treatable)\\ndiseases that look like CFIDS.

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \\n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\\n     be to know God.\\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\\n\\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\\n         6:3.\\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\\n         unlimited power over all creation).\\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\\n         regarding salvation.\\n\\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\\n     A.  In creation\\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\\n          Heb. 1:3.\\n     B.  In salvation\\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \\n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\\n         active in salvation.\\n         1.  God, the Father\\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\\n             important works:\\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\\n             following ways:\\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \\n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \\n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \\n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------\\nLiane Brown\\n(Internet) brownli@ohsu.edu\\nPortland Oregon\\n\",\n",

Some wonder whether or not the moon could\\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\\n\\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\\nam not a diving expert).\\n\\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).

Both spacecraft will team up with\\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\\n     Japan\\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\\nwhile within view on Earth.\\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\\'s project manager for the\\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\\n     \"One of our main activities is developing the methodology\\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\\ncelestial objects,\" said Smith.\\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\\n     \"There is a long history of radio astronomy using\\nground-based telescopes,\" said Smith. \"What we intend to do is to\\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy.\"\\n     Smith noted that if one examines \"the active galactic\\nnuclei, you\\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\\nthan you would expect.\"\\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\\nthe jets. Smith hopes that \"by using Space VLBI to look further\\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.\"\\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\\'s\\nparticipation in the project.\\n     \"Nothing is ever smooth,\" he said, \"but the Russians have\\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.\"\\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\\nscience mission.\\n     \"The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,\"\\nhe said.\\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\\nambitious project, JPL\\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\\n     \"Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\\nother.

One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He\\nordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and\\nhis signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says,\\n\"See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand,\" or else, \"See\\nwhat a long letter I have written with my own hand.\" If the former\\ntranslation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the\\nsmall script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters\\nlarger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the\\nGalatians (4:13-15),\\n\\n + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached\\n + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial\\n + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an\\n + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you\\n + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.\\n\\nPerhaps this last line means simply, \"You would have done anything\\nfor me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes).\"\\nBut in that case, we would expect some wording like, \"If I had\\nneeded them.\" \"If it were possible\" sounds as though the bodily\\nailment was connected with his eyes.\\n\\nWilliam Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific\\nsuggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he\\nhad been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor. If he had had\\na malarial attack while there, a doctor would have advised him to\\nleave the low country and head for the hills. Malaria might well\\nhave given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n',\n",

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

The question\\n> is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions.\\n\\nThis is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding\\nof what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth\\'s\\natmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive\\nanswer is \"photosynthesis\", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis\\nby itself can\\'t make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced\\nis consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed\\nis photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of\\nthe resulting reduced material.\\n\\nOn earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic\\nmatter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires\\ncontinental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow\\nthat most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).\\n\\nThis suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without\\ncontinents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating\\nan oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a\\nhard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.\\n\\nThere is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth\\'s atmosphere\\nhas been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least\\n2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to\\nweathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback\\nmechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak\\nanthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen\\nlevel had dropped too low, we wouldn\\'t be here to be wondering about\\nit.\\n\\n\\tPaul F.

But I don\\'t really\\nthink that\\'s what he\\'s saying anyway.  See below.\\n\\n>If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone\\n>else in this group does too?), why doesn\\'t Jesus or any of the apostles\\n>speak out against it?

In it Paul at least hints that a\\ncertain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not the\\nsame as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a better\\ncomparison would be to indentured servitude.  I don\\'t really want to get\\ninto a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate your\\npoint, I don\\'t think it is relevent, because the original poster did not\\nsay that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not\\nimmoral.\\n\\n   Back to the original poster\\'s assertion.  He is not in fact making\\nthe logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the\\nBible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that\\nthe Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.\\n_Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the\\ncontrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the\\nBible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what\\nit says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we\\nbaptize infants.\\n\\n   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something\\nis not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if\\nsomething cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be\\nasserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,\\nusing the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between\\nproving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are\\ntheories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually\\nproving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling\\ninto is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is\\nfalse.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.\\n\\n   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use\\nScripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism,\\nalthough the evidence seems to me to favor it.\\n\\n-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\nSteve Creps, Indiana University\\ncreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu\\n',\n",

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n',\n",

Post it only\\nif you think it of general interest.\\n\\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\\nfind it relevant.\\n\\nA listmember asks:\\n\\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\\n\\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\\n\\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\\n\\nHOWEVER!\\n\\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\\n\\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\\n\\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\\ntogether.\\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it\\'s time to move on.\\n      She says: What are you talking about?\\n      He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and\\nyounger.\\n      She says: But you can\\'t. We are married!\\n      He says: What are you talking about? We never got married.\\n      She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the night\\nwe first made love. You said: \"My love for you is as deep as the\\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\\n      He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When a\\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\\nthings like that. You mustn\\'t take them literally.\\n\\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\\na matter of public record.\\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don\\'t\\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\\nor just \"poetry.\"\\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\\n\\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\\nthe probate judge\\'s interpretation of them is not at all what you\\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\\nand \"till death do us part.\"\\n\\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\\nthat hasn\\'t?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\\nother and are living together, isn\\'t that marriage in the eyes of\\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\\nout on? \" The original questioner said: \"Good grief, I never thought\\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\\nsomeone who says, \"We don\\'t need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\\nbother.\\n\\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\\ncommitment, \\'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\\nus do part.\\' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver\\'s\\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\\n\\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?\\n\\n Yours,\\n James Kiefer\\n',\n",

Space Science\\nDept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail\\nproposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to\\ngenerate interest in the project. I\\'ll typein the handout he gave out at\\nthe meeting. Here goes : \\n\\n\\t\\t\\tThe Microlight Solar Sail\\n\\t\\t\\t-------------------------\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized\\nfabric which would be necessary to transport a \\'conventional\\' type\\nspacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely\\nbe electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control\\nmethods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a\\npanel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.\\n\\nThe key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at\\nEdinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data\\ngathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.\\n\\n3.Missions\\nThe craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:\\na) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved\\nareas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive\\nsunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that\\nvolatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these\\nlocations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft\\ncauses it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged\\ntube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat\\nis reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300\\ndeg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating\\ncontainer.\\n\\nContact: Colin Jack                              Tel. 0865-200447\\nOxford Mathematical Designs, 131 High Street, Oxford OX1 4DH, England\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThis guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or\\nseeking details or anything, and would be most happy to send you more\\ninformation.\\n\\n\\tAndy\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n                                  ----------------------------------- \\nAndy Jonathan J.

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully\\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\\notherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional\\n\"difficult\" patient.\\n\\nPoint 2:\\n\\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\\na treatment point-of-view.\\n\\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\\n\\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\\nfrom them.\\n\\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m\\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\\n\\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.  I believe the best approach to medical\\ntreatment is one where both the \"humanitarian\" aspects are balanced with and\\nby the \"scientific\" aspects.

That timer is counting down continuously; if it ever hits\\nzero, that means Galileo hasn't heard from Earth in a suspiciously long\\ntime and it may be Galileo's fault... so it's time to go into a fallback\\nmode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances\\nof restoring contact.  I don't know exactly what-all Galileo does in such\\na situation, but a common example is to switch receivers, on the theory\\nthat maybe the one you're listening with has died.\\n-- \\nAll work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology\\n                    - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry\\n\",\n",

For the same quality filter, higher oversampling\\nlets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher\\noversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of\\nall other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should\\nallow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias\\nfiltering.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t---Joel Kolstad\\n',\n",

Then come the\\nProphets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings)\\nand the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra,\\nNehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).\\n\\nAnd the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is\\nquite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past\\n200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead\\nSea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the\\nOld Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas\\nbefore, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.\\n\\nYour Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus\\nwas crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only\\nthe death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as\\nIsaiah predicts, the messiah will be called \"the mighty God.\"  And if he\\nwas God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not\\npossible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead,\\nyour Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is\\nwhy he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.\\n\\nAndy Byler\\n',\n",

For\\nproviding me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.\\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new\\nthing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things\\nfrom past masters.\\n\\n     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called\\nexperts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,\\n\"defies the best principles of launching payloads into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made us mad!  What are these\\nprinciples that SSRT defies?\\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need\\na giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the\\n\"fact\" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it\\nviolates the truism that you cant do anything significant for\\nless than many billions of dollars.\\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\'s experts to teach us\\nsome new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun\\'s first rocket was not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\'s ICBM\\'s didn\\'t take ten years to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950\\'s to remind\\nus of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'s. \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirements -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The\\nALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better\\nknown as \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When\\'s the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in\\n18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of\\none very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn\\'t keep in mind its\\nonly a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps\\nthat can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principles -- a small management\\nteam -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See charts)\\n\\n     I\\'m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last\\ngeneration -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950\\'s\\nand 1960\\'s.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we\\ncould do is soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable\\nand routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal\\nprotection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontally, etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sands in June.  You\\nbring your view-graphs, and I\\'ll bring my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not\\nincluded in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your\\nprogram offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and\\ndecade long programs.]\\n\\n     I bet on my generation and Max Hunter\\'s idea -- Any Takers?\\n',\n",

It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\\nor 75 Statute miles.\\n\\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\\nsection column.  \\n\\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\n\\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\\n\\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\\n\\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,\\nbut he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.\\n \\n>So, I think that your position is:\\n>The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our \\n>interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out \\n>what that truth is.\\n>Did I get that right?\\n\\nNot quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*\\ndetermine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible\\nhuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The \\ndistinction is subtle yet important.\\n\\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\\n\\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\\nright direction when he uttered, \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" yet we have not advanced\\nmuch beyond that.\\n\\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that\\nthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely\\ncertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,\\nyou have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all\\npractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with\\nChristianity.

It\\'s a command to the spacecraft that tells\\nit \"If you don\\'t hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong\\nwith your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode\\nin an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth.\"\\n\\nThe spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other.\\nEarth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,\\nthere\\'s no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft\\'s\\npoint of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything is\\nfine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how long\\nshould the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and\\nbegins to take corrective action?  That \"how long\" is the command loss timer.\\nDuring relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set\\nto rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo \"expect to\\nhear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours\".\\n',\n",

Furthermore, not all\\nwho consider themselves \"christians\" are (even those who manage to head\\ntheir own \"churches\").  \"Not everyone who says to me, \\'Lord, Lord,\\' will\\nenter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who\\nis in heaven.\" - Matt. 7:21.\\n\\n>I also have a problem with the inconsistancies in the Bible, and\\n>how it seems to me that too many people have edited the original\\n>documents to fit their own world views, thereby leaving the Bible\\n>an unbelievable source.\\n\\nAgain, what historical documents do you trust?

No one can browbeat you\\ninto believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving\\nyou further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you\\'ve never read \"A Pilgrim\\'s\\nProgress,\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\\n\\n>Peace and Love\\n>In God(ess)\\'s name\\n>James Moss\\n\\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\\nwrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\\nof the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \\nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).

(Due to the prevailing assumption \\nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\\n\\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \\ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \\nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\\n\\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\\n\\n  \\n1\\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\\n \\n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \\nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \\nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \\n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\\n\\n  The earth isn\\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \\nof a galaxy; we haven\\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \\nbeing stationary, and the sun\\'s image being dragged across the sky by \\nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \\nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \\nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \\nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \\nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \\nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\\n  \\n  The moon isn\\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \\nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\\'s ether field, which is \\nitself in the sun\\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \\nwobble of earth\\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\\' images being dragged around\\nby the sun\\'s ether feild.\\n\\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \\napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \\nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \\nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a \"j\" hook at \\nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \\nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \\n\\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \\ncan be about as big as \"earth\\'s\" shadow upon it, and at other times \\ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       /     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ /                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating \"turntable view\" \\nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\\'ve seen a \\nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \\nday. Try and draw that \"earth shadow.\") Its only the moon\\'s image \\nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \\nbillion humans?) I\\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \\nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \\nfor Pentium!)\\n\\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \\nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \\nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \\nI\\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \\n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \\ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \\ncould get with my machine\\'s receiver next to it.  \\n\\n  If you don\\'t think you\\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \\nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \\nlife\\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \\nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code.

The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can\\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \\nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \\nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \\n\\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \\nour money, and they\\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \\nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \\ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \\nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \\ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \\nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \\nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \\nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \\nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \\nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \\nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \\n\\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, \"its chaos!\" They \\nsaid, \"no, its order.\" He defined chaos as that which is he was not \\nable to control.\\n\\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \\nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \\nlanguage. (telepathic; and \\'vanishing\\' the closest knowledge of death)\\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \\npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \\nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \\nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \\nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \\nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \\ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\\'t eating seeds.\\n\\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \\nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \\nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \\nneed a lot less sleep.\\n\\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \\ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \\neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\\n\\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \\ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \\nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \\nthey aren\\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \\n\\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \\nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \\nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \\nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \\nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples \\nof this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.\\n\\n  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He \\ntells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which \\nthe people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He\\'ll \\nplay a poker face up until he thinks he\\'s cornered, and then he\\'ll \\nwhine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you\\'re willing to \\nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \\nright, and he didn\\'t over play his hand, and he won\\'t need to go \\nback and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over \\nyour destiny, just don\\'t live along a path that leads to a reality \\nin which you don\\'t want to be a part of. \\n\\n  I don\\'t claim to be the first to think these things, its just \\nthat the others could have been \\'pruned\\' from our path. Maybe these \\nthoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.\\n\\n  \\n \\n',\n",

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\n\\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\\n\\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in\\nthe sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.

Larson, 1984, North \\n          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, \\n          hardcover. \\n          \\n\\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to \\n          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. \\n          \\n               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged \\n          edition of \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\", 1959.  \\n          Volume I is \"NOTHING BUT MOTION\" (1979), and Volume II is \\n          \"THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\" (1988). \\n          \\n               Most books and journal articles on the subject of \\n          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial \\n          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by \\n          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except \\n          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  \\n          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical \\n          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual \\n          validity. \\n          \\n               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor \\n          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State \\n          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books \\n          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the \\n          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements \\n          they contain. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" describes the astrophysical \\n          portions of Larson\\'s CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of \\n          \"grand unified field theory\" that orthodox physicists and \\n          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of \\n          space and time: \\n          \\n               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. \\n          \\n               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. \\n          \\n               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a \\n          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic \\n          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the \\n          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-\\n          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was \\n          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with \\n          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including \\n          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 \\n          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, \\n          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They \\n          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And \\n          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation \\n          ready for those also. \\n          \\n               As a result of his theory, which he called \"THE \\n          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM\", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the \\n          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, \\n          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, \\n          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), \\n          \"nuclear\" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass \\n          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in \\n          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be \\n          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very \\n          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, \\n          solutions in principle, \"no other way\" declarations, etc., \\n          used to maintain them. \\n          \\n               \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" is divided into 31 chapters.  \\n          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from \\n          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, \\n          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that \\n          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in \\n          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy \\n          formation from the MYTHICAL \"big bang\" is a big mystery to \\n          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life \\n          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and \\n          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of \\n          SINGLE stars. \\n          \\n               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according \\n          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have \\n          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies \\n          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT \\n          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). \\n          \\n               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against \\n          observations that contradict their theories would find \\n          Larson\\'s explanations quite valuable if considered with an \\n          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY \\n          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the \\n          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray \\n          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from \\n          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any \\n          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional \\n          coincidence).  Larson\\'s explanation is that the gamma ray \\n          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER \\n          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the \"cosmic \\n          sector\".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a \\n          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed \\n          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE \\n          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the \\n          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly \\n          at random. \\n          \\n               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from \\n          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and \\n          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted \\n          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the \\n          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book \\n          \"Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey\", by William K. Hartmann, \\n          says, \"Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if \\n          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars \\n          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.\"  Larson\\'s book contains \\n          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are \\n          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, \\n          astronomers, and astrophysicists. \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (Larson\\'s BOOKS). \\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Book Review is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n          \\n                                   Robert E.

And remember, I am with you always, to the end\\nof the age.\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\\n\\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\\n\\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\\ndictionary??

Tucker\\t\\tKG2S\\t\\t     drt@athena.mit.edu|\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent\\'s.  It\\'s unlikely\\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we\\'re commanded in Mat.\\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I\\'m not the right one to\\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\\n\\nThose who use the three-fold formula don\\'t seem to have a standard\\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus\\'\\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there\\'s a\\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn\\'t require the specific\\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I\\'ve said before, I\\'m\\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

The degree of\\n:elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times\\n:normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal. \\n:As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease. \\n:Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at\\n:least initially, and that\\'s why it\\'s important to tell them apart by means of\\n:a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with\\n:CAH needs to be treated.\\n\\nI just went back to the chapter in Cecil on chronic hepatitis.  It seems\\nthat indeed most cases of CPH are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas\\nthere are a multitude of potential and probable causes for CAH (viral,\\ndrugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  Physicians seem to have a variety of\\n\"thresholds\" for electing to biopsy someone\\'s liver.  Personally, I think\\nthat if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and\\nnormal albumin and PT, one can simply follow them closely and not add the\\npotential risks of a biopsy.

The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that\\nwe did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  \\nThis is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are\\nusually more complex than this example I will use here.\\n        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration\\nof 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,\\nits flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the\\ntime.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.\\n        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several\\ndifferent spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the\\ngalaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a\\nR=8800Mpc.  \\n        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the\\nold standby formula:\\n                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak\\n        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty\\nenergetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.\\nAnd lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call\\nmoderately energetic, I'd say.

The yield goes to Heaven, and\\n|> the waste is burned (destroyed) in Hell.  Why is it necessary to\\n|> punish the waste, rather than just destroy it?\\n \\nLuke 16 talks about the rich man and Lazarus. Matthew 25 talks about \\nthe eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Revelations\\n20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are\\nthrown. Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and\\nthe fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where\\na fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that\\nthe devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the\\nMatthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the\\npunishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or\\nin the sense of continual. \\n \\nFrom Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,\\nif it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living\\nforever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the \\nunbeliever ceases to exist. Whereas, if punishment goes on\\ncontinually, then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.\\nIt definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid\\nregardless of its exact nature. \\n\\nThere seem to be two main questions in Dale's thought:\\nWhat is God's main plan on earth?\\nWhy is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed\\nto simply destroying completely those who refuse God?\\n\\nI believe that God's main plan is to have a genuine relationship\\nwith people.\\n\\nThe nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more\\ndifficult to ascertain. It does seem clear that hell is something\\nto avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has\\nnothing to do with God.\\n\\nIn the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of\\nhell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,\\nit is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can\\ncontinually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or\\nwhether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is\\nburned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a\\nphysical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,\\nat some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is\\nno longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,\\nthe unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell\\ni.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical\\npain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are\\nto be forever without God. \\n \\nThe Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener\\nthink in physical terms in order to get the point that some people\\nwon't listen to God even after he rises from the dead. The point of\\nthe parable is to reach the hard-hearted here who are not listening\\nto the fact of the resurrection nor the Gospel about Jesus Christ.\\nIt seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is\\nnot even remotely pleasant.\\n-- \\nPeter White\\ndisclaimer: None of what is written necessarily reflects \\n     \\t\\t\\ta view of my company.\\n\\tPhil    I want to know Christ and the power of his\\n\\t3:10 \\tresurrection and the fellowship of sharing in\\n\\tNIV\\t\\this sufferings, becoming like him in his death\\t\\n\",\n",

M. Wilson\\n   (London, 1923).\\n\\n2] Another work that might be useful is:\\n   \"The Acts of the Apostles, a Critical Edition with Introduction and\\n   Notes on Selected Passages\", Albert C. Clark (Oxford, 1933;\\n   reprinted 1970).\\n\\n(This is an edition of text of Acts that makes the assumption that the\\ntext in Codex Bezae is the more authentic.  I don\\'t know if it\\nactually contains an english translation or not.)\\n\\n3] Another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is:\\n   \"The Theological Tendency of the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis in\\n   Acts\", Eldon J Epp (Cambridge, 1966).\\n\\n4] The most recent reference I found was an edition in French from the\\nearly \\'80s.  (I can supply the reference if anyone\\'s interested.)\\n\\n5] Now, many of the works are going to be difficult to find.  So if\\nyou\\'re interested in examining the differences in the long recension\\nan excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in:\\n   \"A Textual Commentary on the Greek NT\", Bruce Metzger (United Bible\\n   Society, 1971).\\n\\nMetzger\\'s book serves as a companion volume to the UBS 3rd edition of\\nthe Greek NT.  It contains a discussion on the reasoning that went\\nbehind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in\\nthe UBS3.  Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\\n\\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\\n\\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\\n\\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\\n\\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition\\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\\n\\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\\n\\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\\n\\nN\\n',\n",

Let's do it right this\\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\\n\\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \\n\\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \\ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \\ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\nconstellation.  \\n\\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\\n\\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\\n\\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \\non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \\nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\\n\\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\\nare spent on astronauts.\\n\\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\\n\\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\\norbits.\\n\\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \\nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nNick Szabo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t szabo@techboook.com\\n\",\n",

The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from\\nthe field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing\\nyourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.  \\n\\nThe one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.  Agreed.  But I am\\nstill waiting for Morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two\\nminds making two persons.

In the last few\\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It\\'s\\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \\ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \\npresent to God.  But the best Masses I\\'ve been to were participatory prayers.\\n\\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\\n(which is necessary because no one knows what\\'s happening next) is growing.\\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we\\'d do it\\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \\nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\\nliturgy and since no one knows what\\'s happening, the new things have to be\\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we\\'re just\\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that\\'s just a fact of\\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\\npeople to be aware of the Lord\\'s presence.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\\ngoing down?  I don\\'t mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \\nof God\\'s presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \\njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?\\n\\nJohn Murray\\n',\n",
